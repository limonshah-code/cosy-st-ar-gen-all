## What To Give A Dog For Throwing Up And Diarrhea

Seeing your dog throw up or have diarrhea can be incredibly worrying. My own heart sinks whenever my dog shows signs of an upset stomach. As a pet owner, you naturally want to know what to give a dog for throwing up and diarrhea to help them feel better fast. It is important to act quickly but also carefully. This article helps you understand how to manage these common issues. We will discuss when to seek veterinary help, safe home remedies, and what foods to offer. You will also learn about things to avoid. My goal is to equip you with the knowledge to care for your dog.

**Takeaway:**

*   Always consult your veterinarian for persistent or severe symptoms.
*   Fast your dog for 12-24 hours if symptoms are mild.
*   Offer small amounts of water frequently to prevent dehydration.
*   Introduce a bland diet gradually after fasting.
*   Avoid human medications and rich foods.

When your dog has throwing up and diarrhea, the best initial steps often include a short fast followed by a bland diet of cooked plain rice and boiled chicken. Always ensure constant access to fresh water to prevent dehydration. However, persistent symptoms or severe signs require immediate veterinary attention for diagnosis and proper treatment.

### Recognizing When to Worry and Seek Vet Care

It is scary when your dog starts throwing up or has diarrhea. My first instinct is always to help, but I also know when professional help is needed. While mild cases can often be managed at home, certain signs tell you it is time for a vet visit. Ignoring these warning signals can put your dog at risk. Knowing the difference between a minor upset and a serious problem is vital for your dog's health.

#### Signs of Serious Illness

You need to watch for specific symptoms that indicate a more serious underlying issue. This is not just a simple tummy ache. Your dog might be acting very tired, much more than usual. They might not want to move around or play. A fever is another red flag; your vet can confirm this. If your dog's gums look pale or yellow, this is a serious sign. It means their blood flow is not right or they could have liver problems. Always check your dog's gums if they seem unwell.

#### When Vomiting and Diarrhea are Emergencies

Some situations demand immediate veterinary care. If your dog throws up many times in a short period, this is concerning. Frequent vomiting can lead to rapid dehydration. Bloody vomit or diarrhea, especially if it looks like coffee grounds or black and tarry, is an emergency. This can point to internal bleeding. If your dog tries to vomit but nothing comes out, or their belly looks swollen, it could be bloat. Bloat is a life-threatening condition requiring urgent medical attention. Young puppies, very old dogs, or dogs with existing health problems get sick much faster. Their immune systems are weaker. Never wait to see if these dogs get better on their own. For more information on what constitutes a serious situation, read [When Should I Be Worried About My Dog Throwing Up](https://cosyhomecreation.com/when-should-i-be-worried-about-my-dog-throwing-up).

### Initial Steps: Fasting and Hydration

When my dog first starts throwing up or has diarrhea, I know the first thing to do is usually a short fast. This gives their digestive system a much-needed break. Think of it like resting a tired muscle; the stomach and intestines need time to calm down. It helps stop the irritation. After a fast, ensuring your dog stays hydrated is critical. Dehydration can happen quickly when a dog loses fluids through vomiting and diarrhea.

#### The Importance of a Short Fast

For adult dogs with mild symptoms, a 12 to 24-hour fast often helps their gut recover. This means no food, just water. Do not fast puppies or very small dogs, as they can quickly develop low blood sugar. Older dogs or those with other health problems should also not be fasted without vet approval. The fast allows the inflamed stomach and intestines to rest and begin healing. It also helps you determine if the vomiting or diarrhea is getting worse or better without food in the system.

#### Ensuring Proper Hydration

Water is the most important thing during an upset stomach. Your dog is losing a lot of fluid. Offer small amounts of fresh water frequently, instead of a large bowl. Giving too much at once can trigger more vomiting. You can offer ice chips instead of water if your dog keeps throwing up water. This allows them to lick a small amount at a time. Some vets recommend unflavored Pedialyte for electrolytes, but check with your vet first. Dehydration makes dogs feel much worse and can lead to more serious health problems. Watch for signs of dehydration such as sunken eyes, sticky gums, or loss of skin elasticity.

### Gentle Foods for Recovery: The Bland Diet

After your dogâ€™s digestive system has had a rest, it is time to slowly reintroduce food. This is where the bland diet comes in. The goal is to provide nutrients that are easy to digest. This helps their stomach and intestines recover without causing further irritation. I always start with small portions and watch my dog carefully for any bad reactions. The bland diet is a stepping stone back to their regular food.

#### Cooked Plain Rice and Boiled Chicken

My go-to bland diet is plain, boiled white rice and boiled, skinless, boneless chicken breast. This combination is low in fat and easy on the stomach. The rice provides carbohydrates for energy, and chicken offers lean protein. Prepare the chicken by boiling it until cooked through, then shred it into small pieces. Cook the white rice thoroughly. Mix them in a ratio of about two parts rice to one part chicken. Offer very small amounts, like a tablespoon or two, every few hours. If your dog keeps it down, you can slowly increase the amount and frequency over the next day or two.

#### Other Bland Options

If your dog cannot eat chicken, or if you prefer other options, there are alternatives. Plain boiled ground beef (extra lean and drained of all fat) can replace chicken. Cooked sweet potato or pumpkin (pure canned pumpkin, not pumpkin pie filling) are also excellent choices. These add fiber, which helps firm up stools. Cottage cheese, low-fat and plain, can also be used in small amounts for some dogs. Always avoid any seasonings, oils, or spices when preparing these foods. The simpler, the better for an upset stomach. Remember, for homemade dog food, knowing [How Many Cups of Homemade Dog Food Should My Dog Get](https://cosyhomecreation.com/how-many-cups-of-homemade-dog-food-should-my-dog-get) is important for portion control, especially with a sensitive stomach.

#### Reintroducing Regular Food

Once your dog has been eating the bland diet without any vomiting or diarrhea for 2-3 days, you can start to transition them back to their regular food. Do this slowly. Mix a small amount of their regular kibble with the bland diet. Gradually increase the proportion of kibble over several days. For example, on day one, use 75% bland diet and 25% kibble. On day two, do 50/50. On day three, 25% bland diet and 75% kibble. This slow transition helps prevent a relapse. Watch your dog closely during this time. If symptoms return, go back to the bland diet for a day or two.

### Natural Remedies and Supplements

Beyond a bland diet, certain natural remedies and supplements can support your dog's digestive recovery. I have found some of these helpful for my own dog when dealing with mild tummy troubles. They aim to soothe the gut and restore healthy gut bacteria. However, it is important to remember these are supportive measures. They are not a substitute for veterinary care, especially for severe or ongoing symptoms.

#### Probiotics for Gut Health

Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that live in the gut. They can help restore balance to your dog's digestive system after an upset. When a dog has diarrhea, the natural balance of gut flora can be disrupted. Giving a pet-specific probiotic supplement can replenish these good bacteria. You can find probiotics in powder, capsule, or chewable forms. Always choose a product made for dogs, as human probiotics may not have the right strains for canine guts. Start with the dose recommended on the product label. Probiotics are generally safe and can also be used as a preventative measure during stressful times or after antibiotic use.

#### Slippery Elm Bark

Slippery elm bark is a traditional herbal remedy known for its soothing properties. When mixed with water, it forms a gel-like substance. This gel can coat the lining of the stomach and intestines. It acts as a protective barrier, reducing irritation and inflammation. This helps to calm an upset stomach and ease diarrhea. You can buy slippery elm bark powder at health food stores. Mix a small amount (e.g., 1/4 teaspoon for small dogs, 1/2 teaspoon for medium dogs) with water to form a thin paste. Give this to your dog using a syringe, or mix it with a tiny amount of bland food. Give it at least an hour before or after any medications, as it can interfere with absorption.

#### Ginger

Ginger is well-known for its anti-nausea properties. It can help calm a dog's stomach and reduce vomiting. You can offer very small amounts of fresh ginger. For example, grate a tiny bit (1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon for small to medium dogs) and mix it with a little water or bland food. Alternatively, you can brew a very weak ginger tea. Allow it to cool completely before offering it to your dog. Ginger should be used cautiously and in small doses. Too much can cause stomach upset. Always observe your dog for any adverse reactions after giving any new supplement or remedy.

### Medications and When They Are Used

Sometimes, a bland diet and home care are not enough. Your veterinarian might prescribe medications to help your dog recover from throwing up and diarrhea. These medications target specific symptoms or underlying causes. It is crucial to use only medications prescribed by your vet and to follow their instructions carefully. Never give your dog human medications unless specifically told to by your vet.

#### Anti-Nausea Medications (Prescription)

If your dog is vomiting heavily, your vet might prescribe an anti-nausea medication. Cerenia (maropitant citrate) is a common and very effective drug used for this purpose. It works by blocking receptors in the brain that cause vomiting. This can significantly help your dog feel better and prevent dehydration. Reducing vomiting also allows their stomach to rest and makes it easier to keep down water and food. These medications are usually given as a pill or an injection. Your vet will determine the correct dosage for your dog's weight and condition.

#### Anti-Diarrhea Medications (Prescription)

For persistent or severe diarrhea, your vet may prescribe an anti-diarrhea medication. Metronidazole (Flagyl) is often used for dogs with diarrhea. It is an antibiotic with anti-inflammatory properties that can help resolve certain types of intestinal upset. Tylosin (Tylan powder) is another antibiotic sometimes used for chronic diarrhea. Bismuth subsalicylate (the active ingredient in Pepto-Bismol) can be used, but only under vet guidance and in specific dosages for dogs, as it contains salicylates similar to aspirin, which can be toxic in large amounts or for certain dogs. Always follow your vet's instructions precisely. Understanding [How Long Does It Take for Metronidazole to Stop Diarrhea](https://cosyhomecreation.com/how-long-does-it-take-for-metronidazole-to-stop-diarrhea) can help manage your expectations during treatment. You might also be wondering [How Can I Make My Dog's Diarrhea Go Away Faster](https://cosyhomecreation.com/how-can-i-make-my-dogs-diarrhea-go-away-faster). Often, the prescribed medications work best for this. Also, itâ€™s good to know [How Long Does It Take for Stools to Return to Normal After Diarrhea](https://cosyhomecreation.com/how-long-does-it-take-for-stools-to-return-to-normal-after-diarrhea) which often depends on the cause and treatment.

#### Over-the-Counter Cautions

While some human over-the-counter medications contain ingredients that can help dogs, giving them without veterinary approval is very risky. Many human medications are toxic to dogs, even in small doses. For example, ibuprofen or acetaminophen are extremely dangerous. Even seemingly safe remedies like Imodium A-D (loperamide) should only be given under strict veterinary guidance. Certain dog breeds, like collies and related breeds, can have a genetic sensitivity to loperamide. Always call your vet before giving your dog any human medication. They can advise if it is safe and what the correct dosage would be.

### What to Avoid Giving Your Dog

Just as important as knowing what to give your dog is knowing what not to give them. My biggest rule is: if you are unsure, do not give it. Many common human foods and medications can worsen your dog's condition or even be toxic. Stick to the bland diet and vet-approved treatments. This helps prevent further distress and potential harm. Your dog's recovery depends on careful choices.

#### Human Medications

Never give your dog human medications without direct veterinary instruction. This includes common pain relievers like ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve), and acetaminophen (Tylenol). These drugs are highly toxic to dogs and can cause severe kidney failure, liver damage, or gastrointestinal bleeding. Even small amounts can be fatal. Some human anti-diarrhea medications contain ingredients that are dangerous or require very precise dosing for dogs. Always consult your veterinarian. They are the only ones who can safely advise on medication use for your pet.

#### Fatty or Rich Foods

When your dog has an upset stomach, their digestive system is already inflamed. Giving them fatty or rich foods will only make it worse. Foods like table scraps, cheese, butter, fried foods, or fatty meats can trigger more vomiting and diarrhea. They can also lead to more serious conditions like pancreatitis, which is a painful and potentially life-threatening inflammation of the pancreas. Stick strictly to the bland diet. Avoid anything outside of cooked plain chicken, plain rice, pumpkin, or sweet potato during recovery. Even seemingly harmless treats can cause a setback.

#### Dairy Products

Many dogs are lactose intolerant. This means they cannot properly digest the sugar found in milk and other dairy products. Giving your dog milk, cheese, yogurt, or ice cream when they already have diarrhea or vomiting will almost certainly worsen their symptoms. It can cause increased gas, bloating, stomach pain, and more diarrhea. While some plain yogurt contains probiotics, the lactose content can still be problematic for a sensitive gut. It is best to avoid all dairy products during an episode of gastrointestinal upset.

### Environmental Management and Cleaning

Beyond what you feed your dog, managing their environment is also important. Keeping them comfortable and cleaning up accidents properly helps prevent further issues and maintains a hygienic living space. I know how messy these situations can get, so being prepared for cleanup is key. A clean environment supports a faster recovery and reduces stress for both you and your dog.

#### Keeping Your Dog Comfortable

Provide a quiet, comfortable, and easily cleanable space for your dog to rest. Make sure they have a soft bed or blankets. Ensure they can easily access their water bowl. If they are having frequent accidents, you might want to move their resting area to a tiled floor or a spot that is easy to clean. Limit their activity to allow their body to focus on healing. Avoid rough play or long walks while they are recovering. Monitor their temperature and overall demeanor closely. A calm environment reduces stress, which can sometimes exacerbate gastrointestinal issues.

#### Cleaning Up Accidents Safely

When your dog has diarrhea or throws up indoors, quick and thorough cleanup is important. This prevents odor and the spread of bacteria. Wear gloves and use paper towels or old rags to pick up solids. For liquids, blot as much as you can. Then, use an enzymatic cleaner specifically designed for pet stains. These cleaners break down the biological matter that causes odors and stains. Just cleaning with soap and water might not remove all bacteria or smells. Ensure good ventilation while cleaning. For specific advice on cleaning pet messes, like when you need to know [How Do You Get Diarrhea Out of a Mattress](https://cosyhomecreation.com/how-do-you-get-diarrhea-out-of-a-mattress), specialized cleaners and techniques are crucial. Regular disinfection of areas your dog has soiled is also a good idea. This helps prevent reinfection if a virus or bacteria is the cause.

### FAQ Section

**Q1: Can I give my dog Pepto-Bismol for throwing up and diarrhea?**
A1: You should only give Pepto-Bismol to your dog under strict veterinary guidance. While some vets may recommend it for specific cases, it contains salicylate, similar to aspirin. This can be toxic to dogs in incorrect doses and may mask serious underlying issues. Always consult your vet first to determine if it is appropriate and what the correct dosage would be for your dog's size and condition.

**Q2: How long should I feed my dog a bland diet?**
A2: Typically, you should feed your dog a bland diet for 2-3 days after their symptoms (vomiting and diarrhea) have stopped. The key is to see consistent improvement. Once they are holding down the bland food and their stools are firming up, you can gradually transition them back to their regular diet over several more days to avoid a relapse.

**Q3: What if my dog won't drink water while throwing up?**
A3: If your dog is throwing up water, offer small amounts of water or ice chips frequently. Too much water at once can trigger more vomiting. If your dog refuses water for more than a few hours, or if signs of dehydration appear (sunken eyes, sticky gums, lethargy), seek immediate veterinary care. They may need intravenous fluids.

**Q4: When can my dog go back to normal food after an upset stomach?**
A4: Your dog can start transitioning back to normal food after they have been on a bland diet for 2-3 days with no further vomiting or diarrhea. Begin by mixing a small amount of their regular food with the bland diet. Gradually increase the proportion of regular food over 3-5 days. Monitor closely for any return of symptoms.

**Q5: Can stress cause throwing up and diarrhea in dogs?**
A5: Yes, stress and anxiety can certainly cause gastrointestinal upset, including throwing up and diarrhea, in some dogs. Changes in routine, new environments, separation anxiety, or loud noises can trigger these symptoms. If stress is suspected, addressing the underlying stressor and providing a calm environment can help alleviate the digestive issues.

**Q6: Should I walk my dog if they have diarrhea?**
A6: If your dog has diarrhea, keep walks short and frequent. This allows them to relieve themselves without holding it too long, which can worsen discomfort. Avoid strenuous exercise. If the diarrhea is severe or your dog is very weak, keep them confined to a small, easily cleanable area and only take them outside briefly for potty breaks.
