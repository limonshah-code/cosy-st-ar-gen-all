This creates concave bevels on your blade. Smaller contact wheels (1-4 inches) are useful for grinding tight curves and finger choils. Softer rubber wheels offer a bit more cushion for finishing work. Harder wheels provide a more aggressive cut.

#### Small Wheel Attachments

A small wheel attachment is a game-changer. It holds tiny contact wheels, often from 1/4 inch to 1.5 inches in diameter. These small wheels are perfect for grinding finger grooves. They also work for shaping handle scales and creating detailed jimping on the spine of a knife. This attachment gives you very fine control for intricate work.

#### Flat Platen

Every knife grinder comes with a flat platen. This is a flat, rigid surface that supports the belt. It is used for grinding flat bevels, shaping the blade profile, and squaring up materials. Ensure your platen is truly flat. A worn or uneven platen will result in poor grind lines. Some platens have a ceramic face for reduced friction and heat.

#### Surface Grinding Attachment

For advanced users, a surface grinding attachment can be valuable. This attachment allows you to precisely grind very flat surfaces. It is excellent for squaring up steel stock before you begin forging. It ensures your starting material is perfectly flat. This makes subsequent grinding much easier. While not strictly necessary for every knife maker, it is a nice addition for precision work. Remember that a good [anvil for knife making](https://cosyhomecreation.com/best-anvil-for-knife-making) is also crucial for shaping raw metal.

*   **Ceramic:** Ceramic belts are the most aggressive and longest-lasting. They stay sharp for a long time. They are excellent for rapid stock removal and grinding hardened steels. Ceramic belts are an investment but pay off in efficiency.
*   **Silicon Carbide:** These belts are very sharp but brittle. They are often used for grinding non-ferrous metals like brass or for final finishing stages on steel.
*   **Trizact (Structured Abrasives):** These are specialized belts for fine finishing. They use precisely shaped abrasive structures. They create a very consistent scratch pattern. They are perfect for achieving satin or mirror finishes.

#### Grit Levels

Belt grit refers to the size of the abrasive particles. Lower numbers mean coarser grit, higher numbers mean finer grit.

*   **Coarse Grits (36-80 grit):** Use these for initial stock removal and shaping the blade profile. They remove material quickly.
*   **Medium Grits (120-220 grit):** These grits are for refining the blade shape and starting the bevels. They smooth out the deep scratches from coarser belts.
*   **Fine Grits (320-600 grit):** Use these for finishing the blade surface. They prepare the blade for hand sanding or polishing.
*   **Very Fine Grits (800+ grit, Trizact Axx/Axx):** These are for achieving high-polish finishes or preparing for mirror polishing.

Always work through the grits systematically. Do not skip too many grit levels. This creates better results and saves time in the long run.
