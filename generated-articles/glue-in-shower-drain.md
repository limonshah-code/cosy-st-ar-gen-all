## Dealing with Glue In Shower Drain: Solutions & Prevention

Finding glue in your shower drain can turn a relaxing routine into a frustrating plumbing problem. This sticky situation creates persistent clogs that resist common drain cleaners. Understanding how glue gets there and how to remove it safely saves you time and money. I will guide you through effective methods to tackle a **glue in shower drain** issue. We will explore various removal techniques, discuss essential tools, and provide valuable prevention tips.

### Takeaway

*   Identify the type of glue for the most effective removal method.
*   Use mechanical removal (snaking) first for large glue deposits.
*   Chemical removers require caution and compatibility with your drain pipes.
*   Prevention through careful use of adhesives near drains is crucial.
*   Call a professional for persistent clogs or damaged pipes.

Removing glue from a shower drain often requires specific tools and techniques beyond standard drain cleaners. For fresh, water-soluble glues, hot water can help. For cured glues like epoxy or construction adhesive, mechanical removal with a drain snake or specialized solvents compatible with your pipe material (e.g., PVC or ABS) is necessary to avoid pipe damage.

### Understanding Why Glue Ends Up in Your Shower Drain

Glue does not belong in any drain. Yet, it sometimes finds its way into a shower drain. This typically happens due to accidents or improper disposal. Small amounts of glue can slowly build up, creating a sticky base for other debris. Over time, this causes a major clog.

#### Common Scenarios Leading to Glue Blockages

Accidents are a primary cause. For example, spilled craft glue or hair extension adhesive might go down the drain. Sometimes, people rinse off tools or containers used with strong adhesives in the shower. This seems like a quick clean-up. However, it sends the glue directly into your plumbing system.

Construction or renovation work near the bathroom can also be a culprit. Workers might rinse brushes or tools used with tile adhesive or silicone caulk in the shower. They may not realize the potential damage. These substances harden quickly when exposed to water or air. Once solid, they form a stubborn blockage. This blockage becomes very difficult to remove.

DIY projects around the bathroom often involve glues or sealants. Using a sealant for a new shower door or a strong adhesive for a repair can lead to accidental spills. These spills may then get washed down the drain. Even small drops can accumulate. Over time, they create a significant problem. People often think that water will simply wash away the glue. This is often not true, especially for water-resistant or waterproof glues.

Sometimes, household products contain adhesive properties. For example, certain hair products or beauty treatments might have a sticky consistency. Rinsing these down the drain regularly can contribute to a gradual buildup. While not pure glue, they can act similarly by creating a sticky residue that traps hair and soap scum. This combination forms a powerful clog.

Understanding these pathways helps in preventing future incidents. Always dispose of glues and adhesives properly. Avoid rinsing them down any drain, especially your shower drain. Proper waste disposal prevents many plumbing headaches. This also protects your home's pipes from damage.

### Identifying the Type of Glue in Your Shower Drain

Before you attempt any removal, you must identify the type of glue causing the clog. Different glues react to different solvents and methods. Using the wrong approach can worsen the problem or damage your pipes. Consider the circumstances that led to the clog. This often provides clues about the glue type.

#### Common Glue Types and Their Characteristics

There are several types of glues that might end up in a shower drain. Each type has unique properties. Understanding these properties helps you choose the correct removal method.

*   **Water-Soluble Glues:** These include common craft glues, school glues, or some wallpaper pastes. They are typically white or clear. They dissolve in water, especially hot water. If the clog is recent and the glue is still soft, hot water might be enough.
*   **Super Glue (Cyanoacrylate):** This glue dries very quickly and forms a strong, rigid bond. It is often clear. Acetone, found in nail polish remover, can dissolve it. However, acetone can harm some plastic pipes (like ABS), so use caution.
*   **Epoxy:** Epoxy is a two-part adhesive that forms an extremely strong, hard, and water-resistant bond when mixed and cured. It is very difficult to remove once hardened. Mechanical removal or strong industrial solvents, often not safe for home use, may be necessary.
*   **Construction Adhesive/Liquid Nails:** These are strong, versatile adhesives used for bonding building materials. They are often thick and can be light brown or off-white. They are highly water-resistant and become very hard when cured. Turpentine or mineral spirits might soften them, but these are also harsh on pipes.
*   **Silicone Caulk/Sealant:** This is a flexible, waterproof sealant used around tubs and tiles. It is rubbery when cured. It does not dissolve easily. You usually need to cut or scrape it away. Mechanical removal is often the only option.
*   **Hair Extension Glues/Wigs Adhesives:** These glues are designed to be strong but flexible. They often have specific removers. If these products went down the drain, their removers might help, but compatibility with plumbing should be checked.

Observing the texture and color of the clog can provide hints. Is it hard and brittle like glass? Is it rubbery and flexible? Does it feel tacky or slimy? These observations guide your next steps. For example, a rubbery substance points to silicone. A very hard, unyielding blockage suggests epoxy or construction adhesive.

Knowing your pipe material is also critical. Most modern homes use PVC or ABS plastic pipes for drains. Older homes might have cast iron or copper. Solvents safe for cast iron might damage plastic pipes. Always check product labels for compatibility with your specific drain material. This prevents further damage to your plumbing system. You can often tell if you have [ABS vs PVC shower drain](https://cosyhomecreation.com/abs-vs-pvc-shower-drain) pipes by their color (ABS is black, PVC is white or off-white). This knowledge helps in selecting safe cleaning agents.

### Effective Methods to Remove Glue from Shower Drains

Once you have an idea of the glue type, you can choose the best removal strategy. Always start with the least invasive method. This reduces the risk of damaging your pipes. Persistence is often key, as some glues are very stubborn.

#### Mechanical Removal Techniques

Mechanical methods involve physically breaking up or pulling out the glue. These are often the safest first approach, especially for larger clogs.

1.  **Hot Water and Dish Soap:** For fresh, water-soluble glues, this can be effective.
    *   Boil water, then let it cool slightly for a minute or two. Very hot water can harm PVC pipes.
    *   Pour about a cup of dish soap down the drain.
    *   Slowly pour the hot water down the drain. The soap helps emulsify the glue, and the heat softens it.
    *   Repeat this a few times.
    *   This works best for recently introduced, non-hardened glues.

2.  **Plunger:** A standard cup plunger can create suction to dislodge clogs.
    *   Fill the shower base with enough water to cover the plunger cup.
    *   Place the plunger firmly over the drain.
    *   Plunge vigorously for 15-20 seconds.
    *   Lift the plunger quickly to break the seal.
    *   Repeat several times.
    *   This is more effective for clogs that are not completely solid, or to move softened glue.

3.  **Drain Snake (Auger):** A drain snake is a long, flexible cable with a corkscrew tip. It can break up or pull out clogs.
    *   Remove the shower drain cover.
    *   Feed the snake into the drain opening.
    *   Push and twist the snake until you feel resistance.
    *   Rotate the snake to grab the glue or break it apart.
    *   Pull the snake back out slowly, bringing the clog with it.
    *   This method is powerful for reaching deep clogs. It can also help if you have a [drain snake stuck in shower drain](https://cosyhomecreation.com/drain-snake-stuck-in-shower-drain) from previous attempts. Always be careful not to force the snake, as it can damage pipes.

4.  **Bent Wire or Pliers:** For glue visible near the drain opening, a stiff wire (like a coat hanger) bent into a hook can help.
    *   Bend the end of a wire hanger into a small hook.
    *   Carefully insert it into the drain.
    *   Try to hook onto the glue and pull it out.
    *   Needle-nose pliers can also grab visible pieces.
    *   This is suitable only for shallow, accessible glue.

#### Chemical Removal Strategies (Use with Extreme Caution)

Chemical removers should be a last resort and used with great care. They can be corrosive and emit fumes. More importantly, many solvents can dissolve or weaken plastic pipes (PVC, ABS). Always check the product label for pipe compatibility before use.

1.  **Acetone (for Super Glue):**
    *   Acetone is effective against cyanoacrylate (super glue).
    *   Apply a small amount directly to the glue. Use a cotton swab for precision if possible.
    *   Allow it to sit for a few minutes to soften the glue.
    *   Try to scrape or wipe away the softened glue.
    *   **Warning:** Acetone can damage PVC and ABS pipes. Use sparingly and rinse thoroughly with water immediately after application. It's safer to use this only if the glue is visible and accessible without pouring large amounts down the drain.

2.  **Mineral Spirits or Turpentine (for Construction Adhesives/Oil-Based Glues):**
    *   These solvents can soften oil-based glues.
    *   Pour a small amount directly onto the clog.
    *   Allow it to soak for 15-30 minutes.
    *   Try mechanical methods (plunger, snake) afterward to dislodge the softened glue.
    *   **Warning:** These are strong chemicals. They can also affect some plastic pipes over time. Ensure good ventilation. Rinse with hot, soapy water thoroughly after use.

3.  **Specialized Adhesive Removers:** Some manufacturers produce specific removers for certain types of glue (e.g., silicone removers, epoxy dissolvers).
    *   Read the product instructions carefully.
    *   Verify the remover is safe for your specific pipe material. This is crucial as some removers are highly corrosive.
    *   These are generally designed for surface removal, not pouring down a drain.
    *   Consider consulting a plumbing supply store for advice on specific, drain-safe products if you know the exact glue type.

#### Important Safety Precautions

*   **Ventilation:** Always work in a well-ventilated area when using chemical removers. Open windows and use fans.
*   **Protective Gear:** Wear gloves, eye protection, and old clothes.
*   **Never Mix Chemicals:** Combining different chemical drain cleaners or solvents can create dangerous fumes or reactions.
*   **Read Labels:** Follow all product instructions and warnings carefully.
*   **Pipe Material:** Reiterate the importance of knowing your pipe material. For example, if you have an [ABS vs PVC shower drain](https://cosyhomecreation.com/abs-vs-pvc-shower-drain), certain chemicals could cause damage.
*   **Consequences:** A severe clog from glue can lead to bigger problems, like water backup or even a [clogged shower drain cause a leak](https://cosyhomecreation.com/can-a-clogged-shower-drain-cause-a-leak). This makes safe and effective removal critical.

Start with mechanical methods. If those fail, proceed to chemical solutions with extreme caution. If you are unsure, or the clog persists, it is always best to call a professional plumber. They have specialized tools and knowledge to safely remove even the toughest glue clogs.

### Specialized Tools and Chemicals for Glue Removal

Dealing with a hardened glue blockage in a shower drain often requires more than just a plunger. Specialized tools and carefully selected chemicals can make the job easier and more effective. Using the right tool for the specific type of glue is essential. This prevents further damage to your plumbing system.

#### Advanced Mechanical Tools

1.  **Powered Drain Augers:** For stubborn or deep clogs, a powered drain auger offers more force than a hand-cranked snake. These machines use an electric motor to rotate the cable. This helps to break through harder obstructions like cured glue. They come with various cutting heads designed for different types of clogs. They are more effective but also require more skill to operate. Incorrect use can damage pipes.

2.  **Hydro-Jetters (Water Jetters):** These machines use high-pressure water streams to blast away clogs. They can dislodge even very hard substances like glue. The water pressure can cut through buildup and flush debris away. Hydro-jetters are powerful but should generally be operated by professionals. The high pressure can damage old or weak pipes if not used correctly. They are excellent for thoroughly cleaning pipe walls.

3.  **Inspection Cameras (Borescopes):** Before attempting any major removal, an inspection camera can be invaluable. This small camera on a flexible cable is fed into the drain. It provides a live video feed of the inside of the pipe. This allows you to see the exact nature of the clog, its location, and the type of glue. Knowing precisely what you are dealing with helps choose the most effective and safest removal method. It also helps assess pipe condition.

#### Chemical Solutions and Their Specific Uses

Chemicals for glue removal are typically stronger than standard drain cleaners. Always verify compatibility with your specific drain pipe material (PVC, ABS, cast iron).

1.  **Specialized Solvents:**
    *   **Goo Gone or Citrus-Based Cleaners:** These products are generally milder. They are effective against sticky residues, labels, and some glues like craft glue or sticker adhesive. They contain d-limonene, a natural solvent derived from citrus. They are usually safer for pipes than harsher chemicals.
    *   **Specific Adhesive Removers:** Some brands offer removers tailored for epoxy, polyurethane, or silicone. These are often sold in hardware stores. Read their labels carefully. Ensure they are safe for plumbing applications and your pipe type. These are designed to break down the chemical bonds of specific glues.
    *   **Acetone (with caution):** As mentioned, acetone works on super glue. However, its use in drains is risky due to potential plastic pipe damage. It should only be used if the glue is accessible and you can control the application. You must also ensure immediate and thorough flushing.

2.  **Enzymatic Drain Cleaners (Limited Use):** These cleaners contain bacteria and enzymes that digest organic matter. They are generally safe for pipes and the environment. They are not effective on cured synthetic glues like epoxy or silicone. However, they can help break down hair, soap scum, or food particles that might be trapping softened glue. They are more for maintenance than acute glue removal.

3.  **Professional-Grade Chemicals:** Plumbers have access to stronger, more specialized chemicals. These are not available to the public. They require professional handling due to their corrosive nature and potential for harm. A professional plumber will know which chemical to use safely for your specific clog and pipe type.

Before using any chemical, always try mechanical methods first. If chemicals are necessary, test a small amount in an inconspicuous area if possible. This helps check for adverse reactions with your pipe material. Remember, if you are dealing with significant damage or cannot clear the clog, a professional plumber is the best choice. They can assess the situation and recommend solutions, possibly even a [cast iron shower drain replacement](https://cosyhomecreation.com/cast-iron-shower-drain-replacement) if the glue has caused irreparable damage.

### Preventing Glue and Other Debris in Shower Drains

Preventing glue from entering your shower drain is much easier than removing it. Most drain clogs are preventable with proper habits and tools. Adopting a proactive approach saves you time, money, and frustration in the long run. Good habits keep your plumbing flowing freely.

#### Best Practices for Drain Protection

1.  **Proper Disposal of Adhesives and Chemicals:**
    *   Never pour liquid glues, paints, solvents, or chemicals down any drain. This includes shower drains, sinks, or toilets.
    *   Dispose of unwanted glues, leftover sealants, and adhesive containers according to local hazardous waste guidelines.
    *   Wipe off tools and brushes with rags or paper towels before rinsing them. Dispose of the contaminated rags in the trash.
    *   For containers, let any remaining glue dry inside before throwing them away. This minimizes environmental impact.

2.  **Use Drain Covers and Strainers:**
    *   Install a high-quality drain cover or hair strainer over your shower drain. These devices catch hair, soap scum, and small debris before they enter the pipes.
    *   Choose strainers with fine mesh or small holes. This traps even small particles.
    *   Regularly clean these strainers. Remove trapped hair and debris after every shower. This prevents buildup.

3.  **Avoid Rinsing Certain Items in the Shower:**
    *   Do not wash paint brushes, art supplies, or tools covered in glue or caulk in the shower. Use a utility sink or a designated bucket for cleanup.
    *   Avoid rinsing off hair treatment products that are thick or contain adhesive-like ingredients directly down the drain. Wipe excess off before rinsing.
    *   Ensure small items that might have glue residue do not accidentally fall into the drain.

4.  **Regular Maintenance and Flushing:**
    *   **Hot Water Flush:** Once a week, pour a large pot of very hot water (not boiling, especially for PVC pipes) down the drain. This helps melt away soap scum and grease that can trap other debris.
    *   **Vinegar and Baking Soda:** Periodically, pour 1 cup of baking soda down the drain, followed by 1 cup of white vinegar. Let it sit for 30 minutes to an hour. Then flush with hot water. This creates a fizzing reaction that can help break down minor clogs and odors. It is a gentle, eco-friendly maintenance method.
    *   **Enzymatic Cleaners:** Use enzymatic drain cleaners monthly. These products contain enzymes that digest organic material like hair, soap, and grease. They are gentle on pipes and prevent buildup without harsh chemicals. They do not work on hardened glue, but they keep the drain clear of other clogs.

5.  **Educate Household Members:**
    *   Inform everyone in your home about proper drain etiquette. Explain why certain substances should not go down the drain. This ensures everyone contributes to preventing clogs.
    *   Teach children about responsible disposal of craft supplies. This creates good habits early on.

By following these simple prevention steps, you can significantly reduce the risk of future glue clogs. This helps maintain a healthy and free-flowing shower drain. Proper care prolongs the life of your plumbing system. Regular attention now prevents expensive repairs later.

### When to Call a Professional for Shower Drain Issues

Sometimes, a glue clog in your shower drain is too stubborn or too complex for DIY methods. Knowing when to call a professional plumber saves you from further damage and expense. Attempting to fix severe clogs yourself can lead to bigger problems. These problems include damaged pipes or costly leaks.

#### Signs You Need a Plumber

1.  **Persistent Clogs:** You have tried multiple DIY methods, but the drain remains blocked. This indicates a deep or exceptionally hardened clog that requires specialized tools. A professional has industrial-grade augers and hydro-jetters that are more powerful. They can clear clogs that hand tools cannot touch.

2.  **Slow Drainage After Attempts:** Even if some water drains, it moves very slowly. This suggests the clog is still present, or only partially cleared. A partial clog from glue can quickly become a full blockage again. A plumber can ensure a complete removal.

3.  **Water Backing Up:** If water backs up into the shower or other drains in your home, it signals a significant blockage in the main drain line. Glue in a main line affects multiple fixtures. This situation requires immediate professional attention to prevent flooding or extensive water damage. A [clogged shower drain can cause a leak](https://cosyhomecreation.com/can-a-clogged-shower-drain-cause-a-leak) if water is continuously backing up.

4.  **Foul Odors:** Persistent foul smells coming from the drain, even after cleaning attempts, can mean trapped organic matter is decomposing around the glue. This indicates a very stubborn clog that a plumber can properly clear and sanitize.

5.  **Suspected Pipe Damage:** If you used harsh chemicals or aggressive mechanical methods (like a drain snake) and suspect you might have damaged your pipes, call a plumber immediately. Damaged pipes can lead to leaks, mold growth, and structural damage. A plumber can perform camera inspections to assess pipe integrity. They can also perform a [cast iron shower drain replacement](https://cosyhomecreation.com/cast-iron-shower-drain-replacement) or other pipe repairs if necessary.

6.  **Uncertainty About Glue Type or Pipe Material:** If you do not know what kind of glue is in the drain, or if you are unsure about your pipe material, guessing with chemicals is risky. A plumber can identify the clog and pipe type. This allows them to use the correct and safest removal method.

7.  **No Access to the Clog:** The glue clog might be deep within the plumbing system, beyond the reach of standard consumer drain snakes. Plumbers have longer, more powerful augers that can reach further into your plumbing system.

#### What a Professional Plumber Can Do

A professional plumber offers several advantages:

*   **Expert Diagnosis:** They use specialized equipment, like video inspection cameras, to accurately pinpoint the clog's location and identify its nature. This helps them choose the most effective solution.
*   **Specialized Tools:** They have access to commercial-grade drain snakes, hydro-jetters, and powerful vacuum systems. These tools can dislodge and remove even the most stubborn glue clogs without harming your pipes.
*   **Safe Chemical Use:** If chemicals are necessary, plumbers use professional-grade formulations. They know which chemicals are safe for different pipe materials. They also follow strict safety protocols.
*   **Pipe Repair and Replacement:** If the glue clog has caused damage to your pipes, a plumber can perform necessary repairs or replacements. This might involve replacing a section of pipe. They can also address specific pipe materials, like a [cast iron shower drain replacement](https://cosyhomecreation.com/cast-iron-shower-drain-replacement).
*   **Preventive Advice:** They can offer valuable advice on how to prevent future clogs. This includes proper drain care and maintenance routines.

Do not hesitate to call a plumber if you face any of these situations. Their expertise protects your home and ensures your plumbing system works correctly. Investing in professional help saves you from greater expenses and headaches later.

### Maintaining a Clear Shower Drain System

Regular maintenance is the most effective way to keep your shower drain flowing smoothly. A clear drain prevents clogs, including those caused by glue or other sticky substances. Adopting simple habits can significantly extend the life of your plumbing system and prevent costly repairs. This also ensures a pleasant showering experience.

#### Routine Maintenance Practices

1.  **Daily Hair Removal:** Hair is the number one cause of shower drain clogs. After every shower, visually inspect the drain cover. Remove any hair caught on the strainer or visible in the drain opening. Dispose of it in the trash, not the toilet. This simple step prevents major hair clogs from forming.

2.  **Regular Hot Water Flushes:** Once a week, flush your shower drain with a large volume of hot water. Allow the shower to run on its hottest setting for 5-10 minutes. Alternatively, boil a large pot of water and pour it down the drain (be cautious with very hot water on PVC pipes; let it cool slightly if unsure). Hot water helps melt away soap scum, shampoo residue, and body oils. These substances can coat pipes and trap hair and other debris.

3.  **Baking Soda and Vinegar Treatment (Monthly):** This is a natural and safe way to keep drains fresh and clear.
    *   Pour 1 cup of baking soda down the drain.
    *   Follow with 1 cup of white vinegar.
    *   The mixture will fizz. Let it sit for 30 minutes to an hour. You can cover the drain with a cloth to contain the reaction.
    *   Flush thoroughly with hot water.
    *   This helps break down minor organic buildup and deodorizes the drain. It is not effective on hardened glue, but it prevents the accumulation of other common clog components.

4.  **Enzymatic Drain Cleaners (Quarterly):** Consider using an enzymatic drain cleaner every three to six months. These products contain beneficial bacteria and enzymes. They consume and break down organic materials like grease, soap, and hair. They are non-corrosive and safe for all types of pipes. They work slowly to prevent clogs rather than dissolving existing ones. Follow the product instructions for best results.

5.  **Install a Drain Protector/Strainer:** Use a high-quality drain cover or hair catcher. These simple devices physically block hair and larger particles from entering the drain pipe. They are inexpensive and highly effective. Make sure to clean the strainer regularly, ideally after each shower, to remove trapped debris. This step is particularly crucial for preventing [glue in shower drain] situations, as a clear drain is less likely to trap sticky substances.

6.  **Avoid Grease and Foreign Objects:** Never pour grease or food particles down any drain. While usually a kitchen concern, some people might rinse greasy items in the shower. Grease solidifies in pipes, forming sticky blockages. Also, avoid flushing cotton balls, wet wipes, dental floss, or feminine hygiene products down the toilet or shower drain. These items do not break down and will cause significant clogs.

7.  **Know Your Plumbing System:** Understand the type of pipes you have (e.g., [ABS vs PVC shower drain](https://cosyhomecreation.com/abs-vs-pvc-shower-drain)). This knowledge is vital when considering any chemical cleaners. Different pipe materials react differently to various substances. This ensures you only use products compatible with your plumbing.

By incorporating these routine maintenance tasks, you can significantly reduce the likelihood of severe clogs, including glue blockages. A well-maintained drain system means fewer emergencies and a more reliable home. Prevention is always the best cure for drain issues.

### FAQs About Glue in Shower Drains

#### Q1: Can regular drain cleaner dissolve glue in a shower drain?
Regular drain cleaners are typically designed for organic clogs like hair and soap scum. They use caustic chemicals to dissolve these materials. Most standard drain cleaners will not dissolve hardened synthetic glues like super glue, epoxy, or silicone. Using them on glue can be ineffective and potentially dangerous, creating harmful fumes or damaging your pipes.

#### Q2: Is it safe to pour acetone down a plastic shower drain to remove super glue?
Pouring acetone down a plastic shower drain (PVC or ABS) is generally not recommended. Acetone can soften or dissolve certain plastics over time, leading to pipe damage or leaks. If using acetone for very localized, visible super glue, apply it sparingly with a cotton swab and rinse immediately and thoroughly. Always verify pipe material compatibility.

#### Q3: How can I tell if the glue clog is deep or close to the drain opening?
You can usually tell if the clog is deep by testing with a bent wire or a small flashlight. If you cannot see or reach the glue with a simple tool, it is likely deeper. A drain snake will encounter resistance further down the pipe for deep clogs. If you suspect a deep clog, consider calling a professional plumber for a camera inspection.

#### Q4: What are the risks of leaving glue in a shower drain untreated?
Leaving glue in a shower drain untreated can lead to severe plumbing issues. It will cause slow drainage, eventually leading to a complete blockage. This can result in water backup in your shower, creating a messy flood. Persistent clogs can also cause pressure buildup, potentially leading to pipe leaks or burst pipes, which are costly to repair.

#### Q5: Can boiling water damage my shower pipes?
Pouring boiling water directly down a plastic (PVC or ABS) shower drain can potentially damage the pipes. Very hot water can soften, warp, or even melt plastic pipes, especially if the pipes are old or of lower quality. It is safer to use very hot tap water or water that has cooled slightly from boiling. For cast iron pipes, boiling water is generally safe.

#### Q6: How do plumbers remove hardened glue from drains?
Plumbers use specialized tools to remove hardened glue. They might use a powerful drain auger with specific cutting heads to break up the glue. For very stubborn clogs, they often use hydro-jetting equipment, which blasts high-pressure water through the pipes to
