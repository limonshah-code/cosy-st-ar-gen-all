Installing a Jaclo shower head is generally straightforward. Most models use standard plumbing connections. This means you can often install them yourself.

However, some larger rain shower heads or complex systems might require professional help. These may involve changes to existing piping. If you are replacing an old, stubborn shower head, you might encounter issues. Sometimes, older connections can be corroded. If you find you [can not get shower head off](https://cosyhomecreation.com/can-not-get-shower-head-off), specialized tools or a plumber's expertise might be necessary to avoid damaging pipes. It is important to avoid forcing connections to prevent costly repairs.

Jaclo designs their products for ease of use. Their instructions are usually clear. This helps homeowners complete the installation process without too much trouble.
