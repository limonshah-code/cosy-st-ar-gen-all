Moving to a new home can be upsetting. The loss of a family member, human or animal, causes grief. A new pet or baby can also change their world.

## Consulting Your Veterinarian: The First Critical Step

When your dog seems depressed, your first call should be to the vet. This step is very important. Many medical issues have symptoms like depression. Your dog might be in pain. They might have an infection. They could have an endocrine problem. These hidden health issues can make your dog feel sad. Addressing the physical cause helps the mental state. You cannot help your dog get out of depression without ruling out health problems first.

### Why a Vet Visit is Essential

A vet can perform a full check-up. They will look at your dog's physical health. They might run blood tests. They could suggest X-rays or other scans. These tests help find any underlying sickness. For example, joint pain can limit a dog's movement. This leads to less play and more sadness. Treating the pain improves their mood. Even dental problems can cause chronic discomfort. This can make a dog grumpy and withdrawn.

I remember my own dog, Buddy, seemed down. He stopped greeting me at the door. I thought he missed my son, who had gone to college. But a vet visit showed he had a thyroid issue. Once he started medication, he became his happy self again. This experience taught me how much physical health affects mood. Do not skip this vital step. Your vet is your best partner in this.

Ask about possible treatments. These might include pain relief. They could suggest dietary changes. Medication for anxiety might be an option. Your vet might also recommend specific supplements. Some supplements help brain health. They might suggest behavior training. Sometimes, they refer you to a veterinary behaviorist. These specialists work with complex cases.

Five to ten minutes a few times a day works well.
