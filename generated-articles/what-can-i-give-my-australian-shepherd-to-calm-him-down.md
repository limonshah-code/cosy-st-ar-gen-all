### Clear Answer

To calm your Australian Shepherd, you can provide ample exercise, mental stimulation, a peaceful environment, and consistent training. Natural calming aids like L-theanine, tryptophan, or vet-approved CBD oil may help. Always address underlying causes of anxiety and consult your veterinarian for guidance.

### Understanding Your Australian Shepherd's Energy

Australian Shepherds are known for their boundless energy. They were bred as herding dogs. This means they possess high intelligence and a strong work drive. These traits make them eager to please, but they also require significant stimulation.

Without enough physical and mental outlets, an Aussie can become bored. Boredom often leads to destructive behaviors or excessive barking. It can also manifest as anxiety or hyperactivity. Signs of an overstimulated or anxious Australian Shepherd include pacing, excessive panting, constant alertness, or difficulty settling down. Understanding these signs is the first step toward helping your dog. Providing proper engagement helps them thrive.

Recognizing your Australian Shepherd's needs is vital. They are not just pets; they are intelligent working dogs. Their minds need challenges just as much as their bodies need exercise. Many owners find their Aussies are calmer after a long walk or a vigorous play session.

Remember, a tired Aussie is often a happy and calm Aussie.

### Natural Calming Aids and Supplements

Many owners seek natural options to help their Australian Shepherd calm down. These aids can support their well-being. They often provide gentle relief from anxiety or hyperactivity. Always speak with your veterinarian before starting any new supplement. This ensures the chosen aid is safe and appropriate for your dog.

#### Chamomile and Lavender

Herbal remedies like chamomile and lavender are known for their calming properties. Chamomile can be given as a cooled tea, added to your dog's water, or in a supplement form. Lavender oil can be diffused in a room or applied topically to a calming collar or bandana, but never directly ingested. These plants work to soothe the nervous system naturally. They help reduce tension and promote relaxation.

#### L-Theanine and Tryptophan

L-Theanine is an amino acid found in green tea. It helps promote relaxation without causing drowsiness. Tryptophan is another amino acid. It is a precursor to serotonin, a neurotransmitter that helps regulate mood. Both supplements are available in chewable forms or powders for dogs. They can help your Australian Shepherd manage stress. These compounds are a gentle way to encourage calmness.

#### CBD Oil for Dogs

CBD oil has gained popularity for its potential calming effects. It works with the endocannabinoid system in the body. This system helps regulate various functions, including mood and stress. Ensure you choose a high-quality, third-party tested CBD product specifically made for pets. Dosage is important. Start with a low dose and increase gradually. Always discuss CBD use with your vet first to ensure it is suitable for your Aussie.

#### Zylkene (Hydrolyzed Milk Protein)

Zylkene is a non-prescription supplement. It contains alpha-casozepine, a natural bioactive peptide found in milk. This peptide has calming effects on dogs. It works similarly to how a baby feels calm after feeding from its mother. Zylkene can be given daily or as needed for stressful events. Many owners find it helpful for situational anxiety. It supports a relaxed state without sedation.

### Environmental Adjustments for a Peaceful Home

Your Australian Shepherd's environment significantly impacts their calmness. A chaotic or overly stimulating home can increase anxiety. Creating a quiet and safe space is very important. This space offers a retreat when your dog feels overwhelmed.

Designate a specific area, like a crate or a corner with a comfortable bed. This becomes their den. It is a place where they can relax without interruption. Ensure this area is quiet and free from constant foot traffic. Covering the crate with a blanket can make it feel more secure. This simple act provides a sense of safety for your Aussie.

Reducing sensory overload also helps. Loud noises, bright lights, or constant activity can stress some dogs. Use calming music designed for pets. Soft lighting in their rest area can also promote relaxation. You might also consider using a calming diffuser. Products like Adaptil release synthetic dog appeasing pheromones. These pheromones mimic those mother dogs release to calm their puppies. This can help ease anxiety in dogs of all ages.

Establishing a consistent daily routine is another powerful tool. Dogs thrive on predictability. Regular feeding times, walks, and playtime provide structure. This reduces uncertainty. A predictable schedule helps your Australian Shepherd feel more secure. They learn what to expect, which lowers their stress levels. A calm environment fosters a calm dog.

### Training Techniques to Promote Calmness

Training is crucial for teaching an Australian Shepherd to calm down. It is not just about obedience; it is about building self-control. Positive reinforcement methods work best. They strengthen your bond with your dog. Consistent training helps your Aussie understand expectations.

The "place" command is very useful. It teaches your dog to go to a specific spot, like a mat or a bed, and stay there. This gives them a clear directive for relaxing. Start with short durations and gradually increase the time. Reward calm behavior in their "place." This helps them associate that spot with peace.

Mat training is an extension of the "place" command. It teaches your dog to settle quietly on a designated mat. This skill is valuable in various situations, from visitors arriving to vet visits. You can practice this by rewarding your Aussie for lying down on the mat. Gradually extend the time they stay there. This builds their ability to relax on cue.

Desensitization and counter-conditioning are effective for specific fears. If your Aussie is anxious about loud noises, slowly expose them to quiet sounds. Pair this with positive experiences like treats or praise. Gradually increase the volume over time. This changes their emotional response. They learn to associate the scary sound with good things.

Reward-based training is essential for fostering calm. When your Australian Shepherd offers a calm behavior, such as lying down quietly, reward them immediately. Use treats, gentle praise, or a soft stroke. This reinforces the desired behavior. They learn that being calm brings positive outcomes.

Impulse control exercises are also key. Teaching "leave it" or "wait" helps your Aussie manage their excitement. These commands teach them to pause and think before acting. This reduces impulsive behaviors. A calm person can better guide their dog.

This makes training more effective.

### The Role of Diet and Nutrition

What you feed your Australian Shepherd can significantly impact their behavior. A balanced, high-quality diet supports overall health. It also affects their mood and energy levels. Poor nutrition can contribute to hyperactivity or anxiety.

Choose a dog food with quality ingredients. Look for identifiable meat sources as the first ingredient. Avoid fillers, artificial colors, and preservatives. These can sometimes trigger adverse reactions in sensitive dogs. A diet rich in whole foods provides stable energy. It also helps maintain balanced blood sugar. This prevents sudden energy spikes or crashes.

Omega-3 fatty acids are vital. They are found in fish oil or flaxseed oil. These fatty acids support brain health. They can also help reduce inflammation. Research suggests Omega-3s may have a calming effect on some dogs. Adding a vet-approved Omega-3 supplement to your Aussie's diet can be beneficial. It helps support their nervous system.

The gut-brain axis is also important. A healthy gut contributes to a healthy mind. Probiotics can support a balanced gut microbiome. Some studies link gut health to mood and behavior. If your Australian Shepherd has digestive issues, this can affect their overall well-being. A probiotic supplement might help improve their gut health. This could indirectly contribute to a calmer demeanor.

Lastly, be aware of food sensitivities. Some dogs react to certain ingredients, like specific grains or proteins. These reactions can manifest as hyperactivity or irritability. If you suspect a food sensitivity, talk to your vet about an elimination diet. This involves removing suspect ingredients and reintroducing them one by one. This helps identify the problematic food. Adjusting their diet can make a real difference in how your Australian Shepherd feels and acts.

### Enrichment and Mental Stimulation

Physical exercise alone is often not enough for an Australian Shepherd. Their intelligent minds need constant challenges. Mental stimulation is just as important as physical activity for calming an active breed. A bored Aussie often becomes a restless or anxious Aussie.

Puzzle toys are excellent for mental enrichment. These toys require your dog to problem-solve to get a treat. They engage your Aussie's mind. This satisfies their natural curiosity. Examples include KONG toys stuffed with peanut butter or interactive treat dispensers. These toys keep them occupied. They also provide a healthy outlet for their energy.

Nose work and scent games are fantastic activities. Australian Shepherds have a strong sense of smell. Hiding treats around the house or yard encourages them to use their natural instincts. This activity is mentally tiring. It provides a quiet, calming form of engagement. It does not overstimulate them. You can use snuffle mats or teach them to find specific items.

Training new tricks or refreshing old ones also provides mental stimulation. Learning new commands keeps their brains active. It also strengthens the bond between you and your dog. Even 10-15 minutes of training sessions daily can make a big difference. This focused interaction helps burn mental energy. It directs their intelligence into positive activities.

Appropriate chew toys are also beneficial. Chewing is a natural, self-soothing behavior for dogs. It can release endorphins, which have calming effects. Provide durable chew toys appropriate for your Aussie's size. This gives them a safe and productive outlet for stress or excess energy. It helps prevent destructive chewing on household items.

Addressing boredom-related anxiety is key. If your Australian Shepherd is acting up, consider if they are under-stimulated. Increasing mental challenges can often lead to a calmer, more content dog. They need a job to do, even if it is just solving a puzzle. This satisfies their innate drive and reduces restless behaviors.

### When to Seek Professional Help

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, your Australian Shepherd remains anxious or overly energetic. This is when professional help becomes essential. There might be underlying issues that require expert attention. Do not hesitate to seek guidance from qualified professionals.

First, always consult your veterinarian. A vet can rule out any medical conditions contributing to your dog's behavior. Pain, thyroid imbalances, or other health issues can manifest as anxiety or hyperactivity. A full physical exam and possibly blood tests can provide answers. Your vet can also offer advice on supplements or discuss prescription medication if necessary. They are your primary resource for your dog's health.

If medical issues are ruled out, a certified professional dog trainer or behaviorist can offer specialized guidance. They have experience with canine behavior. They can observe your Australian Shepherd. They will help identify the triggers for their anxiety or hyperactivity. They can then create a tailored training plan. This plan addresses specific behavioral challenges. They use positive, effective methods. A trainer can teach you techniques to help your Aussie cope.

For severe or persistent behavioral issues, a veterinary behaviorist is the ideal choice. These are veterinarians with advanced training in animal behavior. They understand both the medical and psychological aspects of dog behavior. They can diagnose complex behavioral disorders. They can prescribe medication if appropriate. This is often done in conjunction with behavior modification. They provide a comprehensive approach to challenging cases.

Medication should be considered a tool, not a cure. It can help manage severe anxiety or phobias. This allows other behavior modification techniques to be more effective. For example, medication might reduce panic during thunderstorms. This makes it easier to use desensitization training. Your vet or veterinary behaviorist will determine if medication is right for your Australian Shepherd.
