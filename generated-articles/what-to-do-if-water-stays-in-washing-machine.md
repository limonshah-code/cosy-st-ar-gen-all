## Washing Machine Won't Drain? How To Fix Water Stays

Have you opened your washing machine door only to find a pool of water at the bottom? It is frustrating when water stays in washing machine after a cycle. This common appliance problem stops laundry day fast. A washing machine that does not drain properly means wet clothes and a potential mess.

I know this issue well. Many homeowners face this exact problem. Fixing it often involves simple steps, not expensive repairs. This guide helps you understand why your machine holds water. We will cover how to safely drain the water. Then, we will walk through common causes and solutions. You will learn to check hoses, clean filters, and inspect parts. By the end, you will have the knowledge to get your washing machine draining again.

### Takeaway

*   **Safety First:** Always unplug the machine before any work.
*   **Manual Drainage:** Drain standing water using a bucket or wet vacuum.
*   **Check Hose:** Ensure the drain hose is not kinked or blocked.
*   **Clean Filter:** Regularly clear debris from the drain pump filter.
*   **Inspect Pump:** Look for clogs or damage in the drain pump.
*   **Test Lid/Door Switch:** Verify safety mechanisms work correctly.

When water stays in a washing machine, the most direct actions involve cutting power, manually draining the water, and then systematically checking the drain hose for kinks or clogs, cleaning the drain pump filter for obstructions, and finally inspecting the drain pump itself for mechanical issues.

## 1. Safety First: Power Disconnection and Water Drainage

Before you do anything else, safety is very important. Working with electricity and water is dangerous. You must cut power to the machine right away. This step protects you from electric shock. It also prevents the machine from starting unexpectedly.

First, find the washing machine's power cord. Pull it directly from the wall outlet. Do not just turn off the machine; unplug it completely. This ensures no electricity reaches the unit. After unplugging, you need to remove the standing water. You cannot work on the machine with a tub full of water.

### How to Drain Water Manually

Draining the water can be messy. Get towels, a bucket, and possibly a wet vacuum.

*   **Front-Loaders:** Most front-load washing machines have a small access panel at the bottom front. Open this panel. You will usually see a small hose and a large cap. Place a shallow pan or towels under this area. Pull out the small hose, remove its cap, and let water drain into your bucket. Be patient; this takes time. Once the small hose drains, twist open the large cap (the drain pump filter cover) slowly. More water will come out.
*   **Top-Loaders:** These machines are often harder to drain from the bottom. You might need to bail water out of the tub. Use a small cup or bowl to scoop water into a bucket. A wet vacuum works best for large amounts of water. You can also try to lower the drain hose into a bucket on the floor. Gravity might help some water flow out.

After you remove all standing water, you can begin troubleshooting. This initial drainage makes it safer and cleaner to inspect internal parts. Remember, the goal is to get all water out before you touch anything inside. This allows you to inspect parts without water pouring everywhere.

## 2. Inspecting the Drain Hose for Kinks and Clogs

Once the machine is empty and unplugged, your next step is to check the drain hose. This hose carries water out of the washing machine. It connects to a standpipe or a utility sink. A problem with this hose is a very common cause when water stays in washing machine.

First, look behind the washing machine. See the large corrugated hose coming out. It goes into a drain pipe or sink. This hose must be straight. It should not have any bends or kinks. Even a small bend can stop water flow. Gently straighten the hose along its entire length.

Next, check the hose's height. The drain hose needs to be at a specific height. If it is too low, water can siphon out prematurely. This leads to empty tubs before the cycle finishes. If it is too high, the pump struggles to push water up. Most manufacturers suggest the hose standpipe should be between 30 and 34 inches high. Check your machine's manual for the exact recommended height.

### Searching for Internal Blockages

A kink is easy to spot. A clog inside the hose is not. Objects can get stuck in the drain hose. Socks, lint, or other small items pass through the pump and lodge in the hose.

*   **Remove the Hose:** Disconnect the drain hose from both the machine and the wall drain. Have a bucket ready, as more water might spill.
*   **Inspect Visually:** Look through the hose if you can. Use a flashlight.
*   **Flush the Hose:** Take the hose outside or to a large sink. Run water through it. If water flows slowly, there is a blockage.
*   **Clear the Blockage:** Use a plumber's snake or a long, flexible brush to push through any debris. Be gentle to avoid damaging the hose.

Ensuring the drain hose is clear and properly positioned fixes many drainage issues. This simple check often saves you from needing complex repairs. Many "water stays in washing machine" problems begin here.

## 3. Dealing with Clogs: The Drain Pump Filter

If the drain hose is clear, the next suspect is the drain pump filter. This filter traps lint, coins, buttons, and other small items. It prevents them from entering and damaging the drain pump. Over time, this filter collects a lot of debris. A clogged filter blocks water from leaving your washing machine. This is a very common reason why water stays in washing machine.

The drain pump filter location varies by machine type:

*   **Front-Loaders:** You usually find the filter behind a small access panel at the bottom front of the machine. It might be on the right or left side.
*   **Top-Loaders:** Some top-loaders have a self-cleaning filter, meaning you do not need to clean it manually. Others might have a filter accessible from inside the tub (often under the agitator) or a small filter near the drain pump underneath the machine. Check your user manual for the exact location.

### Steps to Clean the Drain Pump Filter

1.  **Prepare for Spills:** Even if you drained the machine earlier, more water will likely come out. Place plenty of towels and a shallow pan or bucket under the filter access area.
2.  **Open Access Panel:** If it is a front-loader, open the small panel at the bottom.
3.  **Locate and Remove Filter:** You will see a large, round cap. This is the filter. Some models have a small drainage hose next to it first. If so, drain water from that hose. Then, slowly twist the main filter cap counter-clockwise to remove it. Be ready for water.
4.  **Clear Debris:** Pull the filter out completely. You will likely see lint, hair, coins, buttons, and other foreign objects stuck to it. Remove all this debris by hand.
5.  **Clean the Filter and Housing:** Rinse the filter under running water. Use an old toothbrush to scrub away any stuck-on grime. Also, look inside the filter housing (where the filter sits) for any remaining debris. Use a cloth to wipe it clean.
6.  **Reinstall Filter:** Once the filter is clean, screw it back in firmly. Make sure it is tight to prevent leaks. Close the access panel.

Cleaning this filter regularly prevents many drainage issues. I recommend checking it every few months, especially if you have pets or do a lot of laundry. This simple maintenance step can save you from finding water stays in washing machine in the future.

## 4. Troubleshooting the Drain Pump Itself

If the drain hose is clear and the filter is clean, the problem might be with the drain pump itself. The drain pump is a crucial part. It pushes water out of the machine. If it fails, water stays in washing machine. A broken or clogged pump means no drainage.

The drain pump is usually at the bottom of the washing machine. You might need to tilt the machine or access it from the back. Always ensure the machine is unplugged before touching the pump.

### Signs of a Faulty Drain Pump

*   **No Pumping Sound:** During the drain cycle, you should hear the pump working. If you hear nothing, the pump might not be getting power or it is broken.
*   **Humming Noise, No Water Movement:** If you hear a humming sound but no water drains, the pump motor might be running but the impeller (the part that pushes water) is jammed or broken.
*   **Water Drains Slowly:** A weak or partially failing pump might drain water, but very slowly.

### Steps to Inspect the Drain Pump

1.  **Access the Pump:** This often requires removing the front or back panel of the washing machine. For some models, you might need to tilt the machine onto its side. Refer to your owner's manual for specific access instructions.
2.  **Inspect for Obstructions:** Once you see the pump, look at the connections. Small items like coins, buttons, or even small pieces of fabric can get past the filter and jam the pump impeller. Disconnect the hoses going to the pump. Check inside for anything blocking the impeller. Use pliers or your fingers to remove any debris.
3.  **Check for Damage:** Look at the impeller itself. Is it broken or cracked? A damaged impeller cannot effectively push water.
4.  **Test Pump Continuity (Advanced):** If you have a multimeter, you can check the pump motor for electrical continuity. This determines if the motor is receiving power or if it has an internal electrical fault. This step is for those comfortable with electrical testing.

If you find debris, clearing it might fix the problem. If the impeller is broken or the pump motor is faulty, you will need to replace the drain pump. Replacing a drain pump can be a DIY task. However, if you are unsure, calling a professional is a good idea. Knowing how to access parts may require specific knowledge. For instance, sometimes you need to [remove middle part of washing machine](https://cosyhomecreation.com/how-to-remove-middle-part-of-washing-machine) to get full access to the pump. Remember, many parts of the washing machine are accessible if you know how.

## 5. Examining the Lid Switch or Door Lock Mechanism

Modern washing machines have safety features. These features stop the machine from spinning or draining if the lid or door is open. If this switch or lock breaks, the machine thinks the door is open. This will cause water to stay in washing machine. The machine will not go into its spin and drain cycle.

### For Top-Loaders: The Lid Switch

A top-load washing machine has a lid switch. This switch is often under the main top of the machine, near the hinge. When you close the lid, a small peg or strike plate on the lid presses down on this switch. This tells the machine it is safe to operate.

*   **How to Check:** Open the lid and find the switch. It usually has two wires. You can sometimes bypass it temporarily for testing. For example, use a screwdriver to press the switch down while the machine is trying to drain. If the machine starts to drain, the switch is likely faulty.
*   **Signs of Failure:** The lid switch might click but not activate. It might look visibly broken.

### For Front-Loaders: The Door Lock

Front-load washing machines use a door lock mechanism. This lock secures the door during cycles. It also contains a switch that signals the door is closed and locked. If this lock fails, the machine will not proceed with the drain or spin cycle. It will think the door is not secure.

*   **How to Check:** Listen for the door to click and lock when you start a cycle. If it does not lock, or if it makes strange noises, the lock might be bad. Check for error codes on the display panel. Many machines show a specific code for a door lock issue.
*   **Visual Inspection:** Look for any visible damage to the door latch or the lock assembly.

If you suspect the lid switch or door lock is the issue, replacement is usually necessary. These are specific parts for your machine model. Getting the correct part is important. Replacing them often involves removing the top panel (for top-loaders) or the front panel (for front-loaders). These parts are not usually repairable. This means you replace the whole assembly. This can be a simple fix to get your washing machine to drain again.

## 6. Understanding the Pressure Switch

The pressure switch is a small but important component in your washing machine. It monitors the water level inside the tub. It does this by sensing air pressure from a small air trap at the tub's bottom. When water fills the tub, it compresses air in a tube connected to the switch. The switch then tells the control board how much water is present.

If the pressure switch is faulty, or if its connected air tube is blocked, it can cause drainage problems. For example, a bad switch might tell the machine the tub is empty, even when it is full. This means the machine will not activate the drain pump. Or, it might think the tub is overfilled. This can also prevent the drain cycle from starting, leading to water stays in washing machine.

### How a Faulty Pressure Switch Affects Draining

*   **Overfilling:** If the switch tells the machine there is not enough water (when there is), the machine might keep filling. This overfilling can overwhelm the drain system.
*   **No Drain Cycle:** If the switch fails to signal "water present," the machine might skip the drain phase. It could act as if the tub is already empty.
*   **Mid-Cycle Stop:** The machine might stop mid-cycle with water in the tub. This happens if the switch sends incorrect signals during operation.

### Inspecting the Pressure Switch and Air Tube

1.  **Locate the Switch:** The pressure switch is usually near the top of the machine's control panel. It has a small, clear or black rubber hose connected to it.
2.  **Check the Air Tube:** Disconnect the air tube from the pressure switch. Blow through the tube. You should hear air bubbling in the tub. If you do not hear bubbles, the tube is likely clogged. Debris or detergent residue can block it. Use a small wire or compressed air to clear the blockage.
3.  **Test the Switch (Advanced):** Testing the pressure switch requires a multimeter. You can check for continuity at different pressure levels. This is more advanced. For most people, if the tube is clear and other checks failed, replacing the switch is the next step.

Replacing the pressure switch is generally easy. It usually involves disconnecting the old one and plugging in the new one. Ensure you get the correct part for your specific washing machine model. A working pressure switch ensures your machine knows its water levels. This allows it to complete cycles correctly, including draining all the water.

## 7. Professional Help: When to Call a Technician

You have tried all the common troubleshooting steps. You have checked the hose, cleaned the filter, inspected the pump, and looked at the lid switch and pressure switch. Still, water stays in washing machine. At this point, it is wise to consider calling a professional appliance repair technician.
