This uniform structure provides superior lubrication. It reduces friction and wear within the engine. Synthetic oil flows better in cold temperatures. This ensures proper lubrication from the moment your generator starts. It also resists breakdown at high temperatures. This is important for air-cooled engines like those in Generac generators. They run hotter than liquid-cooled engines.

Synthetic oil also helps keep the engine cleaner. It forms fewer deposits and sludge over time. This extends the life of engine components. It can even allow for longer oil change intervals. While the initial cost is higher, the benefits outweigh it. These benefits include better engine protection and extended generator life. Choosing synthetic is an investment in your generator's future.

## Conventional vs. Synthetic Blend: Making the Right Oil Choice

When selecting oil, you often face a choice: conventional, synthetic blend, or full synthetic. Each type has its own characteristics. Conventional oil is refined from crude oil. It is the least expensive option. It provides basic lubrication for many engines. However, it breaks down faster under extreme heat. It also flows less efficiently in cold weather.

Synthetic blend oil is a mix of conventional and synthetic base oils. It offers some of the benefits of full synthetic oil. This includes improved cold flow and heat resistance. It comes at a lower price point than full synthetic. It is a good middle-ground option for some engines. For a Generac 22kw, which runs hot, full synthetic is usually preferred.

Generac typically recommends full synthetic for its home standby units. This is due to the demanding operating conditions. Air-cooled engines generate a lot of heat. Full synthetic oil handles this heat better. It provides consistent protection. While conventional oil might be used for initial break-in, it's generally not recommended for long-term use in these generators. Always refer to your generator's manual for specific instructions regarding oil type, especially for initial uses.

## Essential Oil Maintenance Tips for Generac 22kw Generators

Proper oil maintenance is critical for your Generac 22kw generator. This goes beyond just picking the right oil. Regular checks and changes prevent major issues. First, always check your oil level before each start-up, especially if the generator has been idle. Use the dipstick provided. The oil level should be between the "add" and "full" marks.

Oil changes are essential. Generac recommends changing the oil after the first 20-25 hours of operation. This is the break-in period. After that, changes are typically recommended every 200 hours or annually, whichever comes first. If your generator runs frequently or in dusty conditions, more frequent changes may be needed. Always change the oil filter when you change the oil. The oil filter removes contaminants from the oil. A dirty filter reduces oil flow.

Use a drain pan to collect old oil. Dispose of used oil responsibly. Never pour it down drains or onto the ground. Proper oil disposal protects the environment. Follow these simple steps. Your Generac 22kw generator will give you many years of reliable service.
