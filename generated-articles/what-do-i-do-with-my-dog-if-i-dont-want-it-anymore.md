## What Do I Do With My Dog If I Dont Want It Anymore?

It is a difficult situation when you find yourself unable to keep your dog. You might feel guilt or sadness, but also a sense of overwhelm. Finding a safe, loving new home for your pet becomes the priority. This article explores ethical and responsible options for what to do with your dog if you no longer want it. We will guide you through alternatives, rehoming avenues, and crucial steps to ensure your dog's well-being.

### Takeaway

*   **Explore Alternatives:** Look for solutions before deciding to rehome your dog.
*   **Prioritize Safety:** Ensure your dog's welfare during the rehoming process.
*   **Use Ethical Resources:** Connect with shelters, rescues, or trusted networks.
*   **Avoid Abandonment:** Never leave your dog unattended or alone.

If you no longer want your dog, the best approach is responsible rehoming. This involves exploring alternatives, contacting reputable animal shelters or rescues, seeking private rehoming, or utilizing breed-specific groups. These steps ensure your dog finds a safe and loving new home without being abandoned.

### Understanding Why You No Longer Want Your Dog

Life changes happen; sometimes they affect our ability to care for a pet. It is important to identify the true reasons for wanting to rehome your dog. This understanding can help you choose the best path forward. My own experience has shown me that honesty in this assessment helps everyone.

Financial burdens often play a significant role in an owner's decision. Unexpected vet bills or ongoing costs for food and supplies can become too much. If finances are the only issue, resources might exist to help you. Sometimes, a dog develops behavioral problems that become hard to manage. A previously calm dog might start showing aggression or excessive barking. Such issues can strain a household and lead to thoughts of rehoming.

Allergies are another common reason for giving up a pet. A new family member might develop severe reactions to pet dander. Moving to a new home that does not allow pets also forces many difficult decisions. Even lifestyle changes, like a new job with long hours, can reduce the time available for pet care. A dog needs daily attention and exercise. If you cannot provide this, it is unfair to the dog.

Health problems in the dog can also be overwhelming. Chronic conditions or disabilities might require specialized care you cannot provide. This can be emotionally and financially draining. Acknowledging the reason helps you explain your situation clearly to potential adopters or shelters. It also helps you explore all possible solutions first. Thinking through these reasons is a necessary first step.

### Exploring Alternatives to Giving Up Your Dog

Before deciding to rehome your dog, it is wise to explore all available alternatives. Many problems can be solved with proper support. I believe in giving every option a fair chance for your dog's sake.

Behavioral problems often have solutions. Training classes can correct issues like aggression, excessive barking, or house-soiling. Certified professional dog trainers can assess your dog's specific needs. They offer guidance and techniques to modify unwanted behaviors. Sometimes, a simple change in routine or environment can make a big difference. For instance, increased exercise often reduces destructive chewing.

Financial difficulties do not always mean you must give up your dog. Many organizations offer assistance for pet owners in need. You can find programs that help with food costs or veterinary care. [What happens if you don't have money to take your dog to the vet?](https://cosyhomecreation.com/what-happens-if-you-dont-have-money-to-take-your-dog-to-the-vet) This question is common, and many resources exist. Some charities provide temporary financial aid. Look for local pet food banks or low-cost veterinary clinics in your area.

Allergies can be managed, too. Air purifiers with HEPA filters can reduce pet dander in the home. Regular grooming, including bathing, also helps minimize allergens. Some people find relief by designating certain areas of the house as pet-free zones. A good quality air purifier can make a difference for family members with sensitivities. Consider a [best air purifier for dog allergies](https://cosyhomecreation.com/best-air-purifier-for-dog-allergies) if this is your main concern.

Lifestyle changes might require adjustments, not rehoming. If your work schedule becomes too busy, consider hiring a dog walker or using a doggy daycare. Friends or family might also offer temporary help. Exploring these options shows your commitment to your dog's well-being. It is always better to try solving the problem before seeking a new home.

### Responsible Options for Rehoming Your Dog

If alternatives do not work, responsible rehoming becomes the next step. Your goal is to find a safe and loving environment for your dog. This process requires patience and careful consideration. I always advise using ethical channels.

#### Reputable Animal Shelters and Rescues

Animal shelters and rescue organizations are often the first place people consider. These groups are designed to care for unwanted animals. They work to find new, suitable homes for them. Shelters provide food, medical care, and safe housing. Many conduct thorough background checks on potential adopters.

The process usually involves an intake interview. You explain your situation and provide your dog's history. This includes health records, vaccination history, and behavioral quirks. Shelters often have a surrender fee to help cover care costs. It is important to know that shelters can be crowded. They might not always have space immediately. Some shelters are "no-kill," meaning they do not euthanize animals for space or time limits. Others might have to make difficult decisions if animals are sick, aggressive, or cannot be adopted. Always ask about their policies.

#### Private Rehoming Through Your Network

Rehoming your dog privately can be an excellent option. This gives you more control over who adopts your dog. Start by telling friends, family, and co-workers that your dog needs a new home. Word-of-mouth often leads to great matches. You already trust these people, which adds a layer of security.

Use social media carefully. Post clear photos and a detailed description of your dog. Highlight your dog's personality, habits, and any special needs. Explain why you need to rehome. Ask people to share your post widely. Be cautious with strangers online. Always screen potential adopters thoroughly. Request references and perform a home visit. A rehoming contract can also protect your dog and you. This helps ensure your dog goes to a loving, stable environment.

#### Breed-Specific Rescues

If you own a specific breed, a breed-specific rescue might be the best choice. These organizations specialize in one type of dog. They understand the breed's unique characteristics and needs. They often have waiting lists of people wanting that specific breed. This increases the chance of finding a knowledgeable and dedicated owner.

Breed rescues often have a network of foster homes. Your dog can stay in a home environment while waiting for adoption. This reduces stress compared to a shelter setting. They also provide medical care and behavior assessments tailored to the breed. These rescues are passionate about their specific breeds. They ensure dogs go to homes that truly understand and appreciate them. Research reputable breed rescues online. Contact them to discuss your dog's situation.

### The Process of Surrendering a Dog to a Shelter or Rescue

Surrendering a dog to a shelter or rescue involves a structured process. This ensures the organization can properly care for your dog and find it a new home. Knowing what to expect makes the experience less stressful for you and your dog. I understand this decision is never easy, and preparing helps.

First, you need to contact the shelter or rescue directly. Most organizations require an appointment for surrenders. They do not accept walk-ins due to space and staffing limitations. During this initial contact, you will explain your situation. You might be asked about your dog's breed, age, and health status. Some shelters have waiting lists, especially for certain types of dogs or during busy seasons.

When you go for the surrender appointment, bring your dog's medical records. This includes vaccination history, spay/neuter certificates, and any known health conditions. Providing this information helps the shelter provide continuity of care. It also helps them prepare for future adoptions. You will likely complete paperwork. This form asks about your dog's personality, habits, and history. Include details about how your dog interacts with children, other pets, and strangers. Also, mention any fears or special quirks.

Many shelters charge a surrender fee. This fee helps cover the cost of your dog's care. It pays for food, medical treatment, and staff time. The fee amount varies by organization. Be prepared for this expense. The shelter staff will conduct a brief assessment of your dog. They check for overall health and temperament. This evaluation helps them determine the best placement for your dog. They might also discuss behavior issues your dog has. Remember to be honest about all aspects of your dog's behavior. This protects both the shelter and future adopters.

After the surrender is complete, your dog becomes the responsibility of the organization. They will work to find your dog a new home. This might involve fostering, medical treatment, or behavioral training. The goal is always to prepare the dog for a successful adoption. My advice is always to ask about their adoption process and timeline.

### Preparing Your Dog for a New Home

Preparing your dog helps ensure a smoother transition to a new environment. This preparation makes your dog more appealing to potential adopters. It also reduces stress on the dog. I focus on practical steps that benefit your pet directly.

Start with a thorough veterinary check-up. Ensure your dog is up-to-date on all vaccinations. Address any health issues, even minor ones. A healthy dog is more likely to be adopted quickly. If your dog is not spayed or neutered, consider getting this done. Most shelters and rescues require this before adoption. Spaying or neutering also prevents accidental litters.

Focus on basic obedience training. A dog that knows commands like "sit," "stay," and "come" is more manageable. This training makes a dog more pleasant to live with. Consistent routines also help. A well-behaved dog has a much higher chance of quick adoption. Sometimes, behavioral issues arise from lack of routine. While I'm not directly referencing the "don't give up on your routine" article, consistency in training and daily life is vital for dogs.

Gather all your dog's records. This includes vet records, vaccination certificates, and microchip information. Collect information about your dog's favorite toys, food, and daily schedule. Create a detailed profile highlighting your dog's positive traits. Include good quality photos. This profile helps potential adopters learn about your dog's personality. It also shows you are a responsible owner.

Consider having your dog groomed professionally. A clean, well-cared-for dog makes a better first impression. Even simple things like trimmed nails and clean ears matter. Prepare your dog mentally, too. Maintain a calm demeanor around your dog. Dogs pick up on our emotions. Your calm presence helps them feel secure. This preparation is a final act of kindness for your dog.

### Finding the Right Match: Screening Potential Adopters

Finding the right new family is crucial for your dog's future well-being. This step requires careful screening of potential adopters. Your goal is to ensure a safe, loving, and permanent home. I always emphasize thoroughness in this process.

Begin by interviewing all potential adopters. Ask detailed questions about their living situation. Do they live in a house or apartment? Do they have a fenced yard? Inquire about their previous pet ownership experience. How do they plan to exercise the dog? What is their daily routine like? Ask about their family members, including children and other pets. This helps you understand if your dog will fit into their household.

Request personal references. Contact these references to verify the information provided. Ask about the person's character and their history with animals. A veterinarian reference is especially valuable for experienced pet owners. It shows a history of responsible pet care. This step helps confirm the adopter's commitment.

Perform a home visit. This allows you to see the environment where your dog will live. Look for a safe and clean space. Check for potential hazards. Observe how the family interacts with your dog during the visit. A home visit helps confirm their suitability. It gives you peace of mind about your dog's new living conditions.

Consider a trial period. A short trial allows your dog to adjust to the new home. It also lets the new family experience life with your dog. This ensures a good long-term match. A trial period helps prevent the dog from being returned. If the trial is successful, finalize the adoption with a contract. This contract protects both you and the dog. It often includes clauses about proper care, veterinary treatment, and what happens if they can no longer keep the dog. This final step secures your dog's future.

### What to Avoid When Rehoming Your Dog

When rehoming your dog, some actions are dangerous and unethical. Avoiding these pitfalls protects your dog from harm. My most important advice is never to take shortcuts with your pet's safety.

First and foremost, never abandon your dog. Abandonment means leaving your dog somewhere alone, like on the side of a road or in a park. This act is cruel and illegal. Abandoned dogs often suffer from starvation, exposure, or injury. They are vulnerable to traffic accidents or abuse. This is not a responsible option.

Do not give your dog away for "free to good home" without proper screening. While the intention might be kind, this often attracts people with bad motives. Individuals might seek free dogs for dogfighting rings, animal testing, or resale. Always charge a rehoming fee, even a small one. This fee helps filter out those with malicious intent. It also shows a genuine commitment from the adopter.

Avoid using online marketplaces like Craigslist without extreme caution. While some legitimate rehoming happens there, it is full of risks. Many scams operate on such sites. You cannot verify people's identities easily. There is no screening process in place. If you must use such a platform, be incredibly diligent. Always meet in a public place. Do not give out personal information. Follow all screening steps mentioned earlier, including home visits and reference checks.

Do not mislead potential adopters about your dog's temperament or health. Be completely honest about any behavioral issues or medical conditions. Hiding problems leads to failed adoptions. The dog will likely be returned or worse. This dishonesty puts the dog at risk. It also creates a bad situation for the new family. Transparency is key for a successful rehoming. Your dog deserves a family that understands its needs fully.

### FAQ Section

#### Can I just drop my dog off at a shelter?

No, you cannot just drop your dog off. Most reputable shelters require an appointment for surrender. They need to manage space and resources. Contact the shelter beforehand to understand their specific intake process and any required paperwork. This ensures a smoother transition for your dog.

#### Will my dog be put down if I surrender it?

Not necessarily. Many shelters are "no-kill" and will not euthanize for space. However, some shelters might have to euthanize animals due to severe untreatable illness, extreme aggression, or lack of space. Always ask about the shelter's policies before surrendering your dog.

#### Is it bad to rehome a dog?

Rehoming a dog is not inherently bad if done responsibly. Sometimes, it is the most caring option for a dog when an owner can no longer meet its needs. It is far better than keeping a dog in an unsuitable situation or abandoning it. Responsible rehoming ensures the dog finds a loving home.

#### How long does it take to rehome a dog?

The time it takes to rehome a dog varies greatly. It can range from a few weeks to several months. Factors include your dog's breed, age, health, temperament, and your screening process. Popular breeds or well-behaved dogs often find homes faster. Patience is key.

#### What if my dog has behavior problems?

Behavior problems can make rehoming harder. Be honest about these issues with shelters or potential adopters. Many rescues specialize in behavior modification. They might have trainers or foster homes equipped to handle such challenges. Sometimes, a new environment can even reduce certain behaviors.

#### What is the last resort for rehoming?

Surrendering your dog to a reputable, open-admission animal shelter is often considered a last resort. This is when all other options, like private rehoming, family placement, or addressing issues, have been exhausted. It provides a safe place for your dog, even if it carries some risks.

### Conclusion

Deciding to rehome your dog is a profoundly difficult and emotional choice. It speaks volumes about your commitment to your dog's well-being, even when facing personal challenges. Remember, responsible rehoming is an act of kindness, not a failure. My experience has shown me that making this hard choice means prioritizing your dog's future happiness.

You have learned about exploring alternatives like training or financial aid. You now understand the ethical options for what to do with your dog if you don't want it anymore, including working with shelters, rescues, and private networks. Preparing your dog and thoroughly screening potential adopters are critical steps. By avoiding abandonment and other dangerous practices, you ensure your dog has the best chance at a happy, secure life. Your dog deserves a loving home. Take these steps to find that perfect match. Your effort makes a positive difference in your dog's life.
