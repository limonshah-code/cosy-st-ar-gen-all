They often focus on making cleaning easier for busy households.

### Hoover: The Original Vacuum Cleaners

Hoover's story started in 1908. Murray Spangler created a "suction sweeper" to help his asthma. He then sold the patent to William Henry Hoover. Hoover Limited quickly became a household name. The term "Hoover" even became a verb for vacuuming in some countries. Hoover vacuums are known for powerful motors and sturdy construction. I think of Hoover as a brand that prioritizes raw cleaning power and lasting performance. Their long history shows a commitment to basic, effective cleaning technology.

## Vacuum Types and Models: Diverse Cleaning Tools

Both Bissell and Hoover offer a wide array of vacuum types. This diversity allows consumers to choose a model that fits their home and lifestyle. Comparing their product lines helps us see where each brand focuses its efforts.

Their cyclonic technology helps maintain consistent suction power as the dust bin fills. Hoover's filtration often includes HEPA media filters, trapping 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns. This is great for allergy sufferers. While not always as heavily branded for pets as Bissell, many Hoover models perform very well on pet hair. Their brush roll designs are effective at lifting embedded dirt and hair from carpet fibers.

### Bissell's Value Proposition

Bissell vacuums are generally competitive in pricing. You can find entry-level stick vacuums for quick clean-ups at very affordable prices. Mid-range upright and cordless models offer a good balance of features and performance for daily use. Their premium pet-specific vacuums and CrossWave multi-surface cleaners sit at the higher end. However, these models provide specialized functions that justify their cost for many users. I find Bissell offers strong value, especially if your home has pets or a mix of floor types. They often provide innovative solutions without an exorbitant price tag. The overall performance often exceeds expectations for the price paid.
