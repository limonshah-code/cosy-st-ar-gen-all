Dyson might excel on thick carpets with its intense suction. Samsung handles various surfaces well with its efficient system. Think about your specific cleaning needs.

## Navigation and Mapping: Smart Movement

A robot vacuum needs to know where it is going. Good navigation ensures it cleans every part of your home. It also helps the vacuum avoid obstacles. Both Dyson and Samsung use advanced technologies for this. They create maps of your home for efficient cleaning.

### Dyson's 360 Eye and D-shape

Dyson robot vacuums use a unique 360-degree vision system. A camera sits on top of the robot. This camera maps the entire room. It helps the robot understand its surroundings.

It helps the robot avoid things like cables or pet waste. Samsung's app allows you to set "no-go zones" easily. You can also define specific rooms to clean. Many users find Samsung's mapping very intuitive. For overall smart navigation, the [Best Robot Vacuum](https://cosyhomecreation.com/best-robot-vacuum) often has these advanced features.

It also displays the map of where the robot has cleaned. You can view cleaning reports and battery status. The app provides software updates too. Dyson focuses on core cleaning features within its app. It keeps the interface clean and simple to use. This app gives you good control over your cleaning tasks.

### Samsung SmartThings Integration

Samsung robot vacuums often connect to the Samsung SmartThings ecosystem. This is a big advantage if you have other Samsung smart devices. You can control the vacuum through the SmartThings app. This app lets you manage all your smart home devices in one place. You can schedule cleanings, set no-go zones, and view cleaning maps. Samsung robots also support voice control through Bixby, Google Assistant, or Amazon Alexa. Some models even have a built-in camera for home monitoring. This adds a layer of security. This level of integration makes Samsung robots very versatile. The choice between a [cordless vacuum vs robot](https://cosyhomecreation.com/cordless-vacuum-vs-robot) often comes down to these smart features.

Both brands offer good app control. Dyson's app is tailored for its vacuums. It focuses on performance and cleaning details. Samsung's integration with SmartThings is a major plus. It allows for a more connected home experience. If you value a unified smart home system, Samsung might be a better fit. If you prefer a dedicated, straightforward vacuum app, Dyson is good. Consider how you want your vacuum to interact with your other devices.

## Design, Build Quality, and Maintenance

The look and feel of a robot vacuum matter. So does its durability and how easy it is to maintain. Dyson and Samsung both have distinct design philosophies. They also approach build quality and maintenance in different ways. Let's explore these aspects for each brand.
