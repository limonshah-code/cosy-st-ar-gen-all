You will learn when to observe, when to intervene, and how to manage this behavior effectively. By the end, you will have a clear path to address your dog's persistent ear licking.

### Why Won't My Dog Stop Licking My Other Dog's Ears? A Concise Answer

Your dog won't stop licking your other dog's ears for several reasons. These include normal social bonding and grooming. However, it can also signal an underlying medical problem in the licked dog's ear, like an infection. The licking dog might also do it due to stress, anxiety, or seeking attention. Understanding the specific context helps determine the cause and appropriate action.

## Understanding Canine Licking Behavior

Dogs use licking as a primary form of communication. They lick people, objects, and other dogs. This behavior has various meanings. For puppies, licking is a way to seek comfort from their mother. Adult dogs continue this behavior. It helps them show submission or affection. Licking is also a key part of social bonding within a pack. It helps build relationships among dogs.

Sometimes, a dog will lick another dog's ears. This can be a sign of routine grooming. Dogs in a pack often groom each other. This helps keep everyone clean, especially in hard-to-reach areas like the ears. It strengthens their social bonds. This is a normal, healthy interaction. My own dogs often engage in this kind of mutual grooming after a long walk. They clean each otherâ€™s faces and ears. This activity can make both dogs feel secure and loved.

However, repeated or intense licking can be different. If one dog will not stop licking the other dog's ears, it might be more than simple grooming. This could indicate a deeper need or problem. The licking could be a response to something happening with the licked dog. It might also be a sign of a compulsive behavior in the licking dog. Owners must distinguish between normal social interactions and excessive actions. Understanding the nuance helps you decide if intervention is needed.

Pay attention to the licking dog's body language. Also, note the reaction of the licked dog. A calm, relaxed posture suggests normal grooming. If the licking dog seems anxious or the licked dog tries to pull away, it is a different scenario. Observe how often and how long the licking occurs. This information provides important clues. It helps you understand the underlying cause.

## Medical Reasons for Ear Licking

When your dog constantly licks another dog's ears, a medical issue in the licked dog is a strong possibility. Dogs have sensitive ears. They are prone to various health problems. The licking dog might detect an odor or discomfort. This instinct prompts them to attend to the other dog's ears. This behavior is often a helpful signal for owners.

One common medical reason is an ear infection. Bacteria, yeast, or mites can cause infections. These infections lead to inflammation, itching, and pain. The licked dog might shake its head, scratch its ears, or rub its head. You might notice redness, swelling, or a foul odor from the ear. If your dog consistently licks one specific ear, it suggests a problem in that ear. Timely detection of ear issues is crucial. If you suspect your dog's ears need attention, you can learn [how often you should clean your dog's ears if they are infected](https://cosyhomecreation.com/how-often-should-i-clean-my-dogs-ears-if-they-are-infected).

Allergies can also cause ear irritation. Dogs can be allergic to food, pollen, or environmental factors. Allergies cause itchy skin and ears. This leads to scratching and discomfort. The licking dog might be trying to soothe the itchy ears of their companion. Foreign objects like grass seeds can also get lodged in the ear canal. This causes pain and irritation. Insects or ticks might also hide in the ears. These can make the ear very itchy or painful.

Check the licked dog's ears carefully. Look for redness, discharge, or swelling. Gently smell the ears; a yeasty or foul odor indicates trouble. Watch for signs of pain when you touch the ear. If you notice any of these symptoms, a veterinary visit is necessary. A vet can diagnose the problem accurately. They can also provide appropriate treatment. Addressing the medical issue will likely stop the licking behavior.

## Behavioral Reasons: Bonding and Communication

Licking another dog's ears is often a normal part of canine social interaction. Dogs are pack animals. They use various behaviors to communicate and build relationships. Mutual grooming, including ear licking, is a common way for dogs to bond. It strengthens their social ties. This behavior can be comforting for both dogs involved.

One common reason for ear licking is simple affection. Dogs show their love and care for each other in many ways. Licking is a primary sign of affection. It conveys comfort and reassurance. My own dogs often lick each other after playtime. This seems to be their way of settling down and showing companionship. This type of licking is usually gentle and not prolonged.

Submissive behavior is another reason. A dog might lick the ears of a more dominant dog. This shows respect and acknowledges the other dog's higher status. The licking dog might hold a low posture. The dominant dog usually tolerates this behavior. This interaction helps maintain peace within the pack. It reduces potential conflicts.

The licked dog might also enjoy the attention. The licking can feel soothing. It can also stimulate circulation in the ears. Some dogs actively seek out this attention. They might present their ears to another dog. This indicates they welcome the grooming. This mutual exchange reinforces their bond. It creates a feeling of camaraderie.

It is important to observe the context. If the licking is gentle, sporadic, and both dogs seem relaxed, it is likely a positive interaction. This behavior helps establish and maintain social hierarchy. It also fosters a strong sense of companionship. This type of licking does not usually cause any problems. It is a natural part of their relationship.

## Stress, Anxiety, or Attention-Seeking

Sometimes, a dog's persistent ear licking goes beyond normal bonding. It can be a sign of underlying emotional issues. Stress, anxiety, or a need for attention can drive this behavior. The licking dog might feel insecure or bored. This leads them to engage in repetitive actions. This can include licking another dog's ears.

A dog feeling anxious might use licking as a coping mechanism. The act of licking releases endorphins. These are feel-good chemicals. Endorphins help the dog calm down. If a dog feels stressed by changes in routine or environment, licking can become a self-soothing habit. This is similar to how some dogs constantly lick their paws when anxious. For example, if you notice your dog excessively licking its paws, it might be showing signs of stress.

Boredom can also cause excessive licking. Dogs need mental and physical stimulation. A dog without enough activity might seek ways to entertain itself. Licking another dog's ears can become a habit. It fills a void. This type of licking might seem obsessive. The dog might not stop even when the other dog tries to move away. It shows a lack of appropriate outlets for energy.

Attention-seeking is another common behavioral driver. Dogs learn quickly what behaviors get them human attention. If licking the other dog's ears often results in you looking, talking, or approaching, the dog might repeat it. Even negative attention, like telling them "no," can reinforce the behavior. They learn that licking gets a reaction. This can become a manipulative tactic.

Consider recent changes in your home or routine. A new pet, a move, or a change in your work schedule can stress a dog. Provide ample exercise and mental challenges for your dogs. Offer puzzle toys or training sessions. Make sure both dogs receive individual attention. This helps reduce boredom or attention-seeking behaviors.

## Addressing Ear Licking: When to Act

Determining when to intervene in your dog's ear licking behavior is key. Not all licking requires intervention. Some licking is normal and healthy. However, certain signs suggest the behavior is problematic. Recognizing these signs helps you act at the right time. Your goal is to promote both dogs' health and happiness.

You should consider acting if the licking is persistent or obsessive. If your dog licks the other dog's ears for long periods, or cannot be easily distracted, it is a concern. This intensity can cause skin irritation or lead to more serious issues. Observe if the licking dog ignores cues to stop. This indicates a compulsive element. This type of excessive licking needs to be addressed.

Look for signs of distress or injury in the licked dog. The licked ear might become red, raw, or inflamed. Repeated licking can remove protective ear wax. This leaves the ear more vulnerable to infections. The licked dog might also show discomfort. It might pull away, whine, or try to hide. If the licked dog avoids the licking dog, it signals a problem. This means the licking is no longer comforting.

Another red flag is if the licking dog shows signs of anxiety. Excessive licking can be a symptom of underlying stress. The licking dog might pant, pace, or exhibit other anxious behaviors. This indicates they are using licking as a coping mechanism. In such cases, addressing the root cause of anxiety is crucial. Ignoring it can worsen their emotional state.

Finally, if the behavior significantly disrupts your household, it is time to intervene. If the licking prevents either dog from resting, or causes conflict, it needs attention. If you cannot identify a clear cause, or if the problem persists after trying home remedies, consult a vet or a certified dog behaviorist. They can help diagnose any medical issues or behavioral problems. They can then recommend a tailored plan.

## Effective Strategies to Discourage Licking

If you determine that your dog's ear licking is problematic, you need effective strategies. The goal is to stop the unwanted licking. You want to maintain a positive relationship between your dogs. These strategies focus on redirection, training, and addressing the underlying causes. Consistency is key for success.

First, check the licked dog's ears for any medical issues. As discussed, pain or irritation in the licked ear can trigger the behavior. A vet visit for the licked dog should be your first step if you suspect an infection or irritation. Treating the medical problem often resolves the licking. For instance, if the licked dog has an ear infection, treatment will reduce the need for their companion to lick.

If no medical issue exists, focus on redirection. Interrupt the licking gently. Do not punish the licking dog. Instead, redirect their attention. Call their name. Offer a favorite toy or a short training session. When they stop licking and engage with you, reward them. This teaches them alternative behaviors. Provide plenty of appropriate chew toys. This can satisfy their oral fixation. You can also use deterrents to make the ears less appealing. Certain bitter sprays designed for dogs can discourage licking without harming the dog. For broader issues with excessive licking, you might wonder what to put on your dog to make him stop licking himself, and similar deterrents can apply to other dogs. For example, some owners wonder [can I use vinegar to stop my dog from licking](https://cosyhomecreation.com/can-i-use-vinegar-to-stop-my-dog-from-licking) which can be a natural deterrent for obsessive licking.

Increase mental and physical stimulation for the licking dog. A bored or anxious dog often finds unhealthy outlets for energy. Provide more walks, playtime, and training sessions. Puzzle feeders or interactive toys can keep their minds busy. This reduces the likelihood of obsessive behaviors. A tired dog is less likely to engage in unwanted licking. Ensure both dogs get enough exercise.

Practice separation when necessary. If the licking is persistent and causes irritation, separate the dogs for short periods. This allows the licked dog's ears to heal. It also breaks the cycle of the licking behavior. Slowly reintroduce them, supervising interactions closely. Reward calm, non-licking behavior. If the problem persists or worsens, consult a professional dog trainer or behaviorist. They can offer tailored advice and help identify complex behavioral patterns. For similar issues with self-licking wounds, strategies can include special deterrents.

## Maintaining Optimal Ear Health for Both Dogs

Maintaining good ear health for both your dogs is crucial. This helps prevent issues that lead to obsessive licking. Proactive care reduces the chances of infections or discomfort. Healthy ears are less appealing for excessive licking. This ensures your dogs remain comfortable and free from pain.

Regular ear cleaning is a fundamental step. Use a vet-approved ear cleaning solution. Gently wipe the visible part of the ear and the ear canal opening. Do not insert cotton swabs deep into the ear canal. This can push debris further in or damage the eardrum. Frequency of cleaning varies. Some dogs need weekly cleaning, while others need it less often. Dogs with floppy ears or those prone to infections might need more frequent care. This helps remove wax buildup and dirt.

Inspect your dogs' ears regularly. Look for signs of redness, swelling, or unusual discharge. A foul odor, especially a yeasty smell, indicates a problem. Observe if your dog shakes its head, scratches its ears, or rubs its head against furniture. These are signs of discomfort. Early detection of ear issues is important. It allows for prompt treatment. Early treatment prevents problems from becoming severe.

Keep the ears dry, especially after baths or swimming. Moisture creates a warm, damp environment. This is ideal for yeast and bacteria growth. Use a soft towel or cotton ball to dry the ear canals thoroughly. For dogs that swim often, consider using ear drying solutions after each swim. This helps prevent moisture-related problems.

Proper nutrition supports overall health, including ear health. A balanced diet can boost your dog's immune system. This makes them more resistant to infections. If your dog has allergies that cause ear problems, work with your vet. Identify and manage the allergies through diet changes or medication. Managing allergies can significantly improve ear health.

If your dog still experiences recurrent ear problems, consult your veterinarian. They can suggest specific preventative measures. They might recommend special diets or regular ear flushing. Proactive ear care benefits both the licked dog and the licking dog. It reduces the need for obsessive licking behavior. This creates a healthier environment for your whole dog family.
