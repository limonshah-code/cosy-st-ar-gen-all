## Understanding Why Your Dog Digs Under the Fence

Dogs dig for many reasons. It is a natural canine behaviour. Understanding the reason is the first step to stopping it. Dogs might dig to escape the yard. They may also dig for comfort or entertainment.

A common reason is boredom. Dogs need mental and physical stimulation. A dog with too much energy might dig to release it. They might also dig if they are left alone too long. Lack of toys or interaction contributes to this. This is similar to [why a dog might dig at the carpet](https://cosyhomecreation.com/why-is-my-dog-digging-at-the-carpet) inside the house; it's often an outlet for pent-up energy or stress.

Another reason is anxiety. Some dogs dig due to separation anxiety. They try to escape to find their owners. Loud noises or new environments can also cause stress. This stress can lead to compulsive digging. For instance, a dog exhibiting signs of anxiety might also start [barking excessively when you leave your apartment](https://cosyhomecreation.com/how-do-i-stop-my-dog-from-barking-when-i-leave-my-apartment). This connection highlights the need to address the dog's emotional state.

Some dogs have a strong prey drive. They might smell small animals like rodents under the fence. This instinct tells them to dig. They want to find what they smell. This type of digging is often focused and determined. Dogs may also dig to regulate their body temperature. They dig cool spots to lie down in hot weather. They might also dig dens for shelter. Knowing the reason guides your solution.

## Creating Effective Physical Barriers at the Fence Line

Physical barriers are the most direct way to stop digging. These barriers prevent your dog from accessing the soil directly under the fence. You can find many materials for this at Bunnings. The goal is to make digging uncomfortable or impossible.

One popular method uses an "L-footing." This involves attaching wire mesh or chicken wire to the bottom of your fence. You then extend it outward along the ground, forming an "L" shape. Bury the mesh a few inches deep. This creates a barrier that dogs encounter when they try to dig. They hit the mesh and cannot get through. Chicken wire is a common and affordable choice available at Bunnings.

Another effective barrier is burying concrete pavers or large rocks. Dig a trench along the fence line, about 6-12 inches deep. Place the pavers or rocks tightly together in the trench. Fill the trench back with soil. This creates a solid, immovable obstacle. Your dog cannot dig through a solid line of pavers. This method is durable and long-lasting. Bunnings has a wide selection of pavers and garden stones perfect for this purpose.

For a less permanent solution, you can use specialized anti-digging fence panels. These are often made of plastic or metal. They have spikes or prongs that extend into the ground. You push them into the soil along the fence base. They make digging uncomfortable for your dog. These panels are easy to install. They offer a quick fix. Check the gardening or pet sections at Bunnings for these products.

## Utilising Bunnings Products for Anti-Digging Solutions

Bunnings is a great resource for materials to stop your dog from digging. They offer a wide range of products suitable for various fence types. You can find everything from wire mesh to landscaping supplies. This makes it convenient to gather what you need for your project.

For wire mesh barriers, look for galvanised chicken wire or welded mesh. Galvanised options resist rust, making them suitable for outdoor use. They come in different heights and gauges. A heavier gauge wire is more durable. Ask Bunnings staff for advice on the best type for your dog's digging strength.

When considering solid barriers, Bunnings has a variety of concrete pavers, stepping stones, and larger rocks. You can choose options that blend with your garden design. Interlocking pavers can create a very secure base. Remember to calculate the area you need to cover before buying. This ensures you get enough material in one trip.

Beyond the raw materials, Bunnings also stocks tools. You might need a shovel, wire cutters, or gloves. These tools make the installation process much easier. Some stores even have pet-specific solutions in their pet care aisles. You might find ready-made anti-digging fence extensions or deterrent mats there. Always check the product specifications to ensure they are safe for pets.

## Addressing the Root Cause: Boredom and Exercise Needs

Often, dogs dig because they are bored or lack sufficient exercise. A tired dog is less likely to engage in destructive behaviours like digging. Increasing physical activity is a simple yet powerful solution. Daily walks, runs, or active playtime can make a big difference.

Consider different types of exercise. A simple walk around the block is good. However, off-leash play in a secure area provides more stimulation. Fetch, frisbee, or even a hike can burn significant energy. Dogs thrive on routine, so aim for consistent exercise times. This helps them anticipate and fulfill their energy needs.

Mental stimulation is just as important as physical exercise. Dogs need to use their brains. Puzzle toys, treat-dispensing toys, and interactive games keep them engaged. I often use a slow feeder bowl for my dog. It makes mealtime a challenging activity. Hiding treats around the yard can also turn the area into a fun scavenger hunt. This redirects their energy away from digging.

Enrol your dog in obedience training or a dog sport. Activities like agility or nose work provide immense mental and physical stimulation. They also strengthen the bond between you and your dog. A well-exercised and mentally stimulated dog is a happy dog. This reduces their desire to dig out of boredom or frustration.

## Managing Anxiety and Stress-Related Digging

Anxiety and stress are significant motivators for digging. Dogs may dig as a coping mechanism. They might feel anxious when left alone. This is often called separation anxiety. Other stressors include loud noises or changes in their environment. Recognizing anxiety signs is crucial. These signs can include excessive barking, destructive chewing, or pacing. This behavior can be similar to [how a dog gets anxious in the car](https://cosyhomecreation.com/how-do-i-stop-my-dog-from-being-anxious-in-the-car), where they seek an outlet for their stress.

To help reduce separation anxiety, establish a calm departure routine. Avoid making a big fuss when you leave or return. Start with short absences and gradually increase the time. Provide comforting items like a favorite blanket or a chew toy. Background noise, like a radio, can also provide comfort. Some dogs benefit from calming pheromone diffusers. You can find these at pet stores.

Create a safe, comfortable space for your dog. A crate can be a den for some dogs. Ensure it is a positive place, never used for punishment. Make sure they have access to water and shade if they are outside. A familiar toy or your scent on an old shirt can offer comfort. This can reduce their need to escape or dig.

For severe anxiety, consult with a veterinarian or a certified dog behaviourist. They can help diagnose the issue. They might recommend specific training techniques or medication. Addressing the underlying anxiety is key to stopping the digging long-term. Remember that effective solutions take time and patience.

## Using Digging Deterrents and Dig Zones

Deterrents can make the digging area less appealing to your dog. They work by making the soil unpleasant to dig in. You can also create a designated "dig zone." This gives your dog an approved place to satisfy their natural digging instinct.

One common deterrent is scattering unpleasant scents. Dogs dislike strong citrus smells. Orange or lemon peels can be spread along the fence line. Some commercial dog repellents use bitter apple or other tastes. Always ensure any deterrent is non-toxic and safe for your pet. You can also mix in some coffee grounds or cayenne pepper. These scents are often unpleasant to dogs.

Another method involves making the ground itself uninviting. Burying inflated balloons or chicken wire just under the surface can deter digging. When the dog hits the wire or balloon, it creates an unexpected sensation. This often makes them stop digging in that spot. Large, smooth river rocks placed along the fence can also deter digging. They are too heavy and uncomfortable to move.

Consider creating a specific "dig zone" in your yard. This is a designated area where your dog *can* dig. Choose a spot away from the fence. Fill it with sand or loose soil. Bury toys or treats in this area for your dog to find. Teach your dog that this is their special digging spot. Reward them when they dig there. When they try to dig elsewhere, redirect them to the dig zone. This satisfies their instinct safely.

## Consistent Training, Supervision, and Routine

Consistent training and supervision are vital components of preventing digging. Dogs learn through repetition and clear boundaries. A structured routine also helps reduce anxiety and provides predictability. This makes them feel more secure.

When you see your dog attempting to dig near the fence, interrupt the behaviour immediately. Use a firm, clear "No" or a sharp clap. Then, redirect their attention. Offer a toy, suggest a game, or lead them to their designated dig zone if you have one. The key is to catch them in the act. Reward them when they stop digging and engage in the desired behaviour.

Supervision is especially important during the initial training phase. Do not leave your dog unsupervised in the yard until you are confident they have stopped digging. If you cannot watch them, bring them inside or use a confined, secure area. This prevents them from practicing the unwanted behaviour. Consistent supervision reinforces the message that digging under the fence is not allowed.

Establish a clear daily routine for your dog. This includes consistent feeding times, exercise times, and potty breaks. Predictability reduces stress. Dogs thrive on knowing what to expect. A dog with a clear routine is often calmer. This reduces the likelihood of them seeking out destructive activities like digging due to boredom or anxiety. Regular training sessions, even short ones, also reinforce good behaviour and mental engagement.

## Professional Help and Advanced Solutions

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, digging continues. In such cases, seeking professional help is a wise step. A certified dog trainer or a veterinary behaviourist can offer tailored advice. They can assess your dog's specific situation. They help identify underlying causes you might have missed. They also suggest advanced solutions.

A professional trainer can teach you new command and redirection techniques. They can help you implement a consistent training plan. They might also suggest specific tools or methods for your dog's temperament. For example, some trainers use aversion training in a humane way. This makes the digging area truly unappealing without harming the dog. They can show you how to apply these methods correctly.

For persistent or severe digging, especially if linked to deep-seated anxiety, a veterinary behaviourist is the best choice. These professionals have a veterinary degree. They also have specialized training in animal behaviour. They can prescribe medication if needed. They combine behavioural modification with medical treatment. This holistic approach addresses complex behavioural issues.

Advanced physical barriers might also be necessary in some cases. This could include installing deeper fence foundations. Some fences can have a concrete base poured directly underneath. Other options include professional-grade metal mesh sunk deep into the ground. These are more costly solutions. However, they provide maximum security. Consider these if your dog is a determined escape artist. Consulting with a fencing professional can give you options. They understand the specific requirements for different types of fences and terrain. You want a safe and secure environment for your dog.
