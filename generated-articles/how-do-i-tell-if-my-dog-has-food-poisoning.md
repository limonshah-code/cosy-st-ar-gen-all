### How do I tell if my dog has food poisoning?

You can tell if your dog has food poisoning by observing sudden changes in behavior and health. Common signs include vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, loss of appetite, and abdominal pain. Your dog might also drool excessively or seem weak. These symptoms typically appear soon after eating contaminated or toxic food.

### Recognizing the Early Signs of Canine Food Poisoning

Spotting the first signs of illness in your dog is crucial. Dogs cannot tell us how they feel. We must observe their behavior closely. Food poisoning often shows up quickly. It affects how your dog acts and how their body works.

#### Gastrointestinal Upset: Vomiting and Diarrhea

Vomiting is a very common sign of food poisoning. Your dog might vomit food, bile, or even blood. Diarrhea often follows or happens at the same time. This can range from soft stools to watery, foul-smelling liquid. Both vomiting and diarrhea help your dog's body expel harmful substances. Severe or prolonged vomiting and diarrhea can lead to dehydration. Dehydration is a serious concern for dogs.

#### Lethargy and Weakness

A sick dog often loses energy. They might seem tired, sleepy, or just not themselves. They may not want to play or go for walks. They might lie down more than usual. This lethargy comes from their body fighting off toxins. Weakness can also show as difficulty standing or walking steadily. If your dog seems unusually weak, this is a red flag.

#### Loss of Appetite

A healthy dog usually loves mealtime. A dog with food poisoning often refuses to eat. They might turn away from their food bowl. They may even ignore treats they normally love.
