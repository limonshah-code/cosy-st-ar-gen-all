### Factors to Consider When Choosing a Bissell Pet Vacuum

Choosing the right Bissell pet vacuum involves looking at several factors. Your home, pets, and cleaning habits all play a role. Thinking about these points helps you find the perfect model. You want a vacuum that fits your specific needs. This ensures effective and easy cleaning.

First, consider your **floor types**. Do you have mostly carpets, hard floors, or a mix? Some vacuums excel on carpets, while others are better for hard surfaces. Uprights often work well on carpets. Canisters and stick vacuums are versatile for mixed floor types. Second, think about your **pet type**. Do you have a long-haired dog that sheds a lot? Or a short-haired cat? Vacuums with strong suction and tangle-free brush rolls are best for long hair. For general pet hair, most Bissell pet models will work well. For effective removal of all types of hair, including human long hair, you might find useful information in our guide about the [best affordable vacuum for long hair](https://cosyhomecreation.com/best-affordable-vacuum-for-long-hair).

Third, consider **allergies**. If anyone in your home has allergies, look for vacuums with HEPA filters. Also, look for models with a sealed allergen system. These features trap allergens and prevent them from escaping. Fourth, **weight and maneuverability** are important. A lightweight stick vacuum is easy for quick cleanups. A heavier upright might offer more power for deep cleaning. Fifth, decide between **bagged vs. bagless**. Bagless vacuums are convenient. Bagged vacuums can be better for allergy sufferers. Finally, set a **budget**. Bissell offers vacuums at various price points. You can find an effective pet vacuum without spending too much.

### Maintaining Your Bissell Pet Vacuum for Peak Performance

A vacuum cleaner needs regular care to work well. This is especially true for pet vacuums. Pet hair and dander can quickly clog filters and brush rolls. Proper maintenance keeps your Bissell vacuum cleaning effectively. It also extends its lifespan. Taking a few minutes for upkeep saves you time and money later.

**Filter cleaning** is crucial. Most Bissell pet vacuums have washable filters. Check your manual for specific instructions. Wash filters with water as recommended. Let them dry completely before putting them back. Some models use disposable filters. Replace these regularly. Dirty filters reduce suction power. This makes it harder to pick up pet hair. Next, **brush roll maintenance** is important. Pet hair, strings, and debris can wrap around the brush roll. This stops it from spinning properly. Turn off and unplug your vacuum. Use scissors to carefully cut away tangled hair. Remove any stuck debris.

**Emptying the dirt bin** should happen after each use. A full bin reduces suction. For bagged models, change the bag when it is full. Check hoses and attachments for clogs. Sometimes, pet hair can get stuck in these areas. Use a broom handle or a long tool to push out any blockages. Regularly check your vacuum for unusual noises or smells. These can be signs of a problem. Addressing small issues quickly prevents bigger repairs. By keeping your Bissell clean, it will continue to tackle pet hair with ease.

### Beyond Vacuuming: Holistic Pet Hair Management

While a good Bissell vacuum is a powerful tool, it is part of a larger plan for managing pet hair. No vacuum can completely stop shedding. A holistic approach keeps your home cleaner and reduces the amount of hair you need to vacuum. This involves combining different methods. It makes pet ownership even more enjoyable.

One key step is **regular pet grooming**. Brushing your pet often helps remove loose hair before it sheds onto your floors. This is especially important for long-haired breeds. Daily brushing can significantly reduce the amount of hair in your home. It also keeps your pet's coat healthy. Consider professional grooming if your pet has specific coat needs. Another helpful tool is a pet-specific **lint roller**. Keep these handy for quick touch-ups on clothes and furniture. They quickly pick up stray hairs.

Consider **furniture covers** or dedicated pet beds. These items can collect a lot of hair. You can then easily wash them. This keeps your main furniture cleaner. You might also want to look into **air purifiers**. While this article focuses on vacuums, air purifiers can help with pet dander in the air. This is especially useful for allergy sufferers. You can find more information about air quality solutions for homes with pets by checking our resource on [what is pet carpet](https://cosyhomecreation.com/what-is-pet-carpet) to understand how different surfaces retain pet hair and dander. A combination of good grooming, protective covers, and regular vacuuming with your Bissell will create a much cleaner living space.
