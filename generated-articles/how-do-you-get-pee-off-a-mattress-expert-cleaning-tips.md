## Get Pee Off A Mattress: Expert Cleaning Tips

Accidents happen. Whether it is a childâ€™s bedwetting incident, a pet mishap, or a spill, getting pee on your mattress can feel like a major problem. You might worry about lingering stains, unpleasant odors, and damage to your comfortable bed. A soiled mattress affects sleep quality and hygiene in your home.

But do not worry. You can get pee off a mattress effectively with the right approach. This guide provides expert cleaning tips to remove urine stains and smells. We will cover immediate actions, cleaning solutions for fresh and dried stains, and preventative measures. Follow these steps to restore your mattress to a clean, fresh state.

### Takeaway

*   Act immediately to absorb as much urine as possible from the mattress.
*   Use a DIY solution of vinegar, baking soda, and hydrogen peroxide for fresh stains.
*   Apply enzymatic cleaners to break down urine components and eliminate odors.
*   Ensure the mattress dries completely to stop mold and mildew growth.
*   Protect your mattress with a waterproof cover to prevent future accidents.

### Clear, Concise Answer

To get pee off a mattress, act quickly by blotting up fresh urine. Then, treat the area with a mix of white vinegar and water, followed by a generous layer of baking soda. Allow it to dry completely. For tough odors, use an enzymatic cleaner designed for urine.

### Act Immediately: First Steps for Fresh Urine Accidents

A fresh urine stain on your mattress needs immediate attention. The faster you act, the easier it is to get pee off a mattress and prevent stains or odors from setting. Delaying the cleaning process makes the urine seep deeper into the mattress layers. This can cause stubborn odors and permanent stains.

Your first goal is to absorb as much liquid as possible. Gather supplies quickly. You will need paper towels, clean cloths, and gloves. Do not rub the stain. Rubbing pushes the urine further into the fibers. You want to lift the moisture out, not spread it around.

Start by removing all bedding. Take off sheets, blankets, and mattress covers. Wash these items immediately in hot water with laundry detergent. You can also add a cup of white vinegar to the wash cycle for extra odor removal. This ensures they do not retain any urine smell. For best results, use absorbent materials. [Best paper towels for cleaning](https://cosyhomecreation.com/best-paper-towels-for-cleaning) or [best kitchen towels for cleaning](https://cosyhomecreation.com/best-kitchen-towels-for-cleaning) work well for this step.

*   **Gather Supplies:** Collect paper towels, clean absorbent cloths, rubber gloves, and a plastic bag for soiled items.
*   **Remove Bedding:** Strip all sheets, blankets, and mattress protectors from the bed. Put them in the washing machine immediately.
*   **Blot the Stain:** Press firmly with clean paper towels or a dry cloth directly onto the wet area. Stand on the towels if needed to apply pressure. Replace wet towels with dry ones until no more moisture transfers.
*   **Do Not Rub:** Avoid scrubbing. Blotting lifts the urine out, while rubbing pushes it deeper into the mattress. Continue blotting until the area feels only slightly damp.

### Tackling Fresh Stains with DIY Solutions

Once you have blotted most of the liquid, it is time to treat the stain. You can use common household items to make effective cleaning solutions. These solutions help break down the urine components. They also neutralize odors, making it easier to get pee off a mattress. This DIY approach works well for most fresh urine spots.

A mixture of white vinegar and water is an excellent starting point. Vinegar is acidic. It helps to break down uric acid crystals found in urine. It also acts as a natural deodorizer. Mix equal parts white vinegar and cool water in a spray bottle. Spray the solution generously over the urine stain. Make sure the area is damp, but not soaking wet. Let it sit for about 10-15 minutes.

After the vinegar solution, it is time for baking soda. Baking soda is a powerful odor absorber. Blot the vinegar solution lightly with a fresh cloth. Then, sprinkle a generous amount of baking soda over the entire treated area. Make sure to cover it completely. The baking soda will absorb remaining moisture and odors. For deeper cleaning, this method forms part of a general [do it yourself mattress cleaning](https://cosyhomecreation.com/do-it-yourself-mattress-cleaning) strategy.

*   **Vinegar Solution:**
    *   Mix equal parts white vinegar and cool water in a spray bottle.
    *   Lightly spray the entire urine-stained area.
    *   Let the solution sit for 10-15 minutes to penetrate the mattress fibers.
    *   Gently blot the area with a clean cloth to remove excess moisture.
*   **Baking Soda Application:**
    *   Sprinkle a thick layer of baking soda over the damp, treated area.
    *   Ensure the baking soda covers the entire stain, extending slightly beyond the edges.
    *   Leave the baking soda on the mattress for at least 8-10 hours, or even overnight. It needs time to absorb odors and moisture.

### Conquering Dried Urine Stains and Persistent Odors

Dried urine stains present a different challenge. The uric acid crystals in urine can crystallize as the stain dries. This makes them harder to remove and causes a strong, lingering odor. Getting dried pee off a mattress requires a bit more effort. However, it is still possible to achieve good results at home. Enzymatic cleaners are your best friend here.

Enzymatic cleaners contain enzymes. These enzymes break down the organic matter in urine. This includes uric acid crystals and odor-causing bacteria. These cleaners are very effective for both stains and odors. They work by digesting the components of urine. You can often find them at pet supply stores or cleaning aisles. Look for products specifically for pet urine. If you have experience with [how to get dried cat pee out of carpet](https://cosyhomecreation.com/how-to-get-dried-cat-pee-out-of-carpet), you will find similar principles apply to mattresses.

To use an enzymatic cleaner, spray or pour it generously onto the dried stain. Make sure to saturate the area well. The cleaner needs to reach all the urine that soaked into the mattress. Read the product instructions carefully. Most require a specific dwell time, usually a few hours, for the enzymes to work. After the recommended time, blot up any excess liquid. Then, sprinkle baking soda over the area again to absorb remaining moisture and smells. This dual approach helps significantly in removing stubborn odors. It also prepares the mattress for a final cleanup.

*   **Assess the Stain:** Identify the exact areas where the dried urine is present. Mark them if needed.
*   **Apply Enzymatic Cleaner:**
    *   Purchase an enzymatic cleaner designed for urine stains and odors.
    *   Saturate the dried urine stain completely with the cleaner.
    *   Follow the product instructions for dwell time, usually 1-2 hours.
*   **Blot and Reapply Baking Soda:**
    *   After the dwell time, blot up any remaining liquid from the enzymatic cleaner.
    *   Generously sprinkle a fresh layer of baking soda over the treated area.
    *   Let the baking soda sit for several hours or overnight to absorb odors and moisture.
*   **Vacuum Thoroughly:** Use a strong vacuum cleaner to remove the dried baking soda. Consider using a handheld vacuum designed for upholstery for this. A [best vacuum for cleaning upholstery](https://cosyhomecreation.com/best-vacuum-for-cleaning-upholstery) can be very effective for this step.

### Deodorizing and Ensuring a Fresh Mattress

Even after cleaning, a faint urine smell might remain. This is especially true if the urine soaked deep into the mattress. Thorough deodorization is crucial to ensure a fresh, clean bed. Air circulation and specific products play a vital role here. You want to eliminate any last traces of odor.

Baking soda is excellent for absorbing odors. After applying it, let it sit for a long time. Overnight is good, but 24 hours is even better for stubborn smells. The longer it sits, the more odor it absorbs. Once dry, vacuum up all the baking soda. You might need to repeat the baking soda application if the smell persists. This simple step is highly effective for a fresh mattress.

Good ventilation is key for both drying and deodorizing. Open windows and doors in the room. This allows fresh air to circulate. If possible, move the mattress to an area with good airflow. A fan can also help speed up the drying process. Direct sunlight is another powerful natural deodorizer. If you can safely move your mattress outside on a sunny day, it can work wonders. This natural drying helps kill bacteria and dissipate odors. Remember, a dry mattress is a fresh mattress.

*   **Extended Baking Soda Treatment:**
    *   Apply a fresh, thick layer of baking soda over the entire cleaned area.
    *   Leave it on for at least 24 hours to maximize odor absorption.
    *   Vacuum thoroughly once the time is up.
*   **Utilize Air Circulation:**
    *   Open windows and doors in the room to allow fresh air flow.
    *   Place a fan near the mattress to promote faster drying and air circulation.
*   **Sunlight Exposure:**
    *   If feasible, move the mattress outdoors on a warm, sunny day.
    *   Allow it to air out and dry in direct sunlight for several hours. UV rays help kill bacteria and neutralize odors.
*   **Consider Air Purifiers:** For persistent smells, an air purifier can help clean the air in the room. This does not clean the mattress directly but can improve the overall air quality. For instance, you might consider the [best air purifier for cat pee smell](https://cosyhomecreation.com/best-air-purifier-for-cat-pee-smell) or [best air purifier for dog pee smell](https://cosyhomecreation.com/best-air-purifier-for-dog-pee-smell) if pet accidents are common.

### Proper Drying and Preventing Future Accidents

After cleaning and deodorizing, ensuring the mattress is completely dry is critical. A damp mattress is a breeding ground for mold and mildew. These can cause health issues and permanent damage to your mattress. Drying might take several hours, or even a full day, depending on the humidity and how much liquid was used. Patience is important for this step.

Use fans to circulate air around the mattress. You can also use a dehumidifier in the room. These tools help remove moisture from the air and the mattress. Do not put bedding back on until the mattress is bone dry. Press a dry cloth onto the treated area. If it feels damp or cool, it needs more drying time. Moving the mattress to an upright position against a wall can also help air circulate around all sides.

Preventing future accidents saves you time and effort. A waterproof mattress protector is your best defense. These covers create a barrier between the mattress and any liquids. They are easy to remove and wash, making cleanup simple. Look for protectors that are breathable and comfortable. This ensures they do not affect your sleep quality.

*   **Ensure Complete Drying:**
    *   Place fans directly on or around the mattress to accelerate airflow.
    *   Use a dehumidifier in the room to reduce overall humidity.
    *   Allow the mattress to air dry for at least 12-24 hours. The duration depends on the stain size and humidity.
    *   Feel the area. It must be completely dry to the touch before replacing bedding.
*   **Invest in a Waterproof Mattress Protector:**
    *   Purchase a high-quality waterproof mattress protector.
    *   Place it directly over your mattress. It forms a protective barrier against spills and accidents.
    *   Regularly wash the protector according to its care instructions.
*   **Address Root Causes:**
    *   For children, use bedwetting alarms or schedule night-time bathroom trips.
    *   For pets, ensure proper house-training or provide easy access to outdoor relief areas. If you are dealing with [how to remove pet pee smell from carpet](https://cosyhomecreation.com/how-to-remove-pet-pee-smell-from-carpet), you already know the importance of addressing the underlying issue.
    *   Consider a full mattress replacement if accidents are severe and frequent, and the mattress is old.

### When to Call in the Professionals

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, a mattress stain or odor might persist. This can happen with very old, dried stains, or large accidents. If you have tried all home remedies and are still struggling, professional cleaning services are an option. They have specialized equipment and stronger cleaning agents. These are designed to deep clean mattresses.

Professional cleaners use powerful extraction machines. These machines can draw out urine and cleaning solutions from deep within the mattress. They also have access to industrial-strength deodorizers. These products can break down even the most stubborn urine odors. Hiring a professional can save your mattress from needing replacement. It also ensures your bed is truly clean and hygienic.

Consider calling a professional if:
*   The urine stain is very large or has soaked through multiple layers.
*   The odor persists even after multiple cleaning attempts.
*   You have an older mattress. Older mattresses absorb liquids more readily and are harder to clean effectively at home.
*   You have allergies or sensitivities. Professional cleaning can help remove potential allergens and bacteria that urine leaves behind.
*   You simply do not have the time or tools for a deep clean.

Professional services are an investment. However, they can extend the life of your mattress. They can also ensure a clean, healthy sleeping environment. Get quotes from a few companies. Ask about their methods for urine removal and odor control.

*   **Persistent Stains:** If dark stains remain even after multiple cleaning attempts, professionals can help. They use stronger chemicals and specialized tools.
*   **Lingering Odors:** If the distinct urine smell refuses to go away, a professional service is wise. Their methods specifically target deep-set odors.
*   **Large Accidents:** For very large spills, where urine has soaked through significantly, home methods may not be enough. Professional equipment can extract more liquid.
*   **Time and Effort:** If you lack the time or prefer not to tackle a major cleaning project, hire experts. They have the experience and efficiency for the job.
*   **Mattress Type:** Some mattress types, like memory foam, are sensitive to liquids. Professionals know how to clean these without causing damage.
