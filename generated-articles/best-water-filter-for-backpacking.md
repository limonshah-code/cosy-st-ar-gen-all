The most important factor is what the filter removes. Most backpacking filters remove bacteria (like E. coli, Salmonella) and protozoa (like Giardia, Cryptosporidium). Some advanced filters also remove viruses. Viruses are smaller and harder to filter out.

Look for a filter that meets or exceeds EPA standards for microbe removal. Microfilters typically have a pore size of 0.1 to 0.2 microns. This size blocks most bacteria and protozoa. If you travel internationally, especially in areas with known virus risks, consider a purifier or a filter with a virus removal claim. Knowing what your filter can handle ensures true peace of mind. Some filters also tackle microplastics, which is an emerging concern.

#### Flow Rate and Capacity

Flow rate measures how quickly water passes through the filter. A higher flow rate means less waiting. This is especially helpful when you are thirsty or filtering for a group. Pump and gravity filters generally offer faster flow rates. Squeeze filters can be slower.

Capacity refers to the total volume of water the filter can clean before needing replacement. Filter cartridges have a lifespan, often measured in liters. A higher capacity filter lasts longer. This reduces the need to carry spare filters. For multi-day trips, a filter with a good capacity is a wise choice. Some filters offer capacities of 1,000 to 100,000 liters.

#### Weight and Size

Every ounce matters when backpacking. A lightweight and compact water filter is easier to carry. Squeeze filters are often the lightest and smallest. Pump filters and gravity filters tend to be bulkier. Think about how much space the filter will take in your pack.

Consider the filterâ€™s size both when packed and when in use. A filter that easily fits into a side pocket or small pouch is ideal. Reducing overall pack weight improves your comfort and endurance on long trails. A [best lightweight water filter for backpacking] helps you move faster and farther.
