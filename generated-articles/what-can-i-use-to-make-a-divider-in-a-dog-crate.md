## Crafting the Perfect Fit: Make a Divider for Your Dog Crate

Bringing a new puppy home is exciting. You want to give them the best start. A dog crate is a vital tool for training. But what if your crate is too big for your small puppy? This often happens when you buy a crate for your dog's adult size. This is where a crate divider becomes your best friend.

Knowing [is it better for a dog crate to be too big or too small](https://cosyhomecreation.com/is-it-better-for-a-dog-crate-to-be-too-big-or-too-small) helps you understand the importance of proper sizing. A divider helps create a cozy, appropriately sized space. This article will show you how to make a divider in a dog crate. We will explore various materials and step-by-step instructions. This guide helps you ensure your dog's comfort and training success.

### Takeaway

*   **Proper Crate Sizing:** Use a divider to adjust crate space for a growing puppy.
*   **Material Selection:** Choose safe, durable materials like plywood or PVC.
*   **Safety First:** Ensure the divider is secure, chew-proof, and free of sharp edges.
*   **DIY Benefits:** Save money and customize the divider for your specific crate.

A dog crate divider creates a smaller, more secure space within a larger crate. This helps greatly with puppy potty training and comfort. It gives the puppy just enough room to stand, turn around, and lie down. This setup prevents accidents because puppies do not soil their sleeping areas.

## Why a Dog Crate Divider is Essential for Training

Many people buy a dog crate that fits their dog's adult size. This is smart for long-term use. However, a large crate is too big for a puppy. A puppy needs a snug space. A divider solves this problem. It makes the crate feel safe and not overwhelming.

An appropriately sized crate helps with potty training. Dogs naturally avoid soiling their sleeping area. If the crate is too large, your puppy might use one end as a bed and the other as a bathroom. This defeats the purpose of crate training. For instance, if you are wondering [why does my dog poop in his crate but not in the house](https://cosyhomecreation.com/why-does-my-dog-poop-in-his-crate-but-not-in-the-house), a too-large crate could be the reason. A divider prevents this by limiting space.

Dividers also help manage a puppy's energy. A smaller space can encourage relaxation. It helps them feel secure, like a den. As your puppy grows, you can move the divider. This slowly expands their space until they use the whole crate. This gradual adjustment makes crate training smoother. It ensures your dog always has a comfortable and appropriate space.

## Factors to Consider Before Making a Crate Divider

Before you start building, think about a few important things. Your dog's safety and comfort are top priorities. The type of crate you have also matters. You want a divider that works well and lasts.

First, consider your dog's chewing habits. Puppies chew on everything. Choose materials that are safe if chewed. Avoid anything with splinters or small pieces. Stronger, more durable materials are better for heavy chewers. You do not want your dog to ingest parts of the divider.

Second, look at your specific dog crate. Is it wire, plastic, or fabric? Most wire crates have pre-drilled holes or grooves for dividers. Plastic and fabric crates may need different solutions. Measure the inside dimensions carefully. You need the exact height and width for the divider. A snug fit prevents the divider from shifting or falling over.

Third, think about how the divider will attach. It needs to be secure. You do not want it to wobble or collapse. Some designs involve hooks or clips. Others might use tension or custom fittings. Plan this part carefully to ensure stability. Choosing the right method makes your DIY divider safe and effective.

## DIY Materials for a Sturdy Dog Crate Divider

You have many options for materials when you want to make a divider in a dog crate. The best choice depends on your dog's size, chewing habits, and your budget. Each material has pros and cons. I find it satisfying to use simple materials for pet projects.

### Plywood or Medium-Density Fiberboard (MDF)

Plywood or MDF are popular choices. They are strong and easy to work with. You can cut them to exact size.
*   **Pros:** Very sturdy, good for chewers, paintable, readily available.
*   **Cons:** Can be heavy, may absorb liquids if not sealed, requires tools for cutting.
*   **Tips:** Use pet-safe, non-toxic paint or sealant. Sand all edges smooth to prevent splinters.

### PVC Sheets or Panels

PVC (polyvinyl chloride) is a great, lightweight option. It is durable and moisture-resistant. I like that it is easy to clean.
*   **Pros:** Lightweight, waterproof, easy to clean, cannot splinter, generally chew-resistant.
*   **Cons:** Can be more expensive, less rigid than wood in thin sheets, may require specialized cutting tools for thicker sheets.
*   **Tips:** Choose a thickness that offers good rigidity. Ensure smooth edges after cutting.

### Heavy-Duty Plastic Boards (e.g., HDPE)

These are very durable and often used for outdoor signs. They resist chewing well. They are tough and long-lasting.
*   **Pros:** Extremely durable, waterproof, chemical-resistant, difficult to chew through.
*   **Cons:** Can be expensive, may be harder to cut at home, limited color options.
*   **Tips:** Measure precisely. Seek professional cutting if you do not have appropriate tools.

### Corrugated Plastic Sheets (Coroplast)

This material is light and inexpensive. It is good for temporary dividers or small puppies. My experience tells me it's not for heavy chewers.
*   **Pros:** Very lightweight, affordable, easy to cut with a utility knife, waterproof.
*   **Cons:** Not very durable for strong chewers, can bend or warp over time.
*   **Tips:** Use for puppies or dogs that do not chew much. Reinforce edges with tape or trim.

When selecting your material, prioritize safety. Ensure it does not have any sharp points or rough edges. A smooth, non-toxic surface is always best for your dog.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Making a Plywood Crate Divider

Making a plywood divider is a straightforward project. I prefer plywood because it's sturdy and widely available. Follow these steps for a safe and effective divider.

### Materials You Will Need:
*   Plywood or MDF (1/2 inch to 3/4 inch thick)
*   Tape measure
*   Pencil
*   Saw (circular saw, jigsaw, or hand saw)
*   Sander or sandpaper (medium and fine grit)
*   Drill (optional, for securing)
*   Non-toxic, pet-safe sealant or paint (optional)
*   L-brackets or U-bolts (optional, for wire crates)

### Step 1: Measure Your Crate

First, measure the inside height and width of your dog crate. Measure from the top of the crate floor to just below the top edge. Measure the width between the side walls. Write these measurements down carefully. A precise measurement ensures a snug fit.

### Step 2: Cut the Plywood

Mark your plywood with the exact measurements. Use your saw to cut the piece of plywood. Take your time for a clean, straight cut. If you are not comfortable using power tools, a local hardware store might cut it for you. This step is crucial for fit.

### Step 3: Sand All Edges

After cutting, sand all edges of the plywood. Start with a medium-grit sandpaper. Then, finish with a fine-grit sandpaper. This removes splinters and sharp spots. Smooth edges are important for your dog's safety. Run your hand along all edges to check for roughness.

### Step 4: Seal or Paint (Optional but Recommended)

Plywood can absorb moisture. Apply a pet-safe, non-toxic sealant or paint. This protects the wood. It also makes the divider easier to clean. Allow the sealant or paint to dry completely. Follow the product instructions for drying times.

### Step 5: Install the Divider

Place the divider inside the crate. It should fit snugly. For wire crates, you can often slide it into the wire mesh. Some crates have slots for dividers. If your crate does not have slots, you can secure the divider. Use small L-brackets or U-bolts to attach it to the crate wires. Ensure all attachments are on the outside of the crate or fully covered. This prevents your dog from chewing them. The divider should stand firm and not wobble.

## Alternative Divider Solutions and Ready-Made Options

While DIY dividers are great, sometimes you need other options. There are ready-made dividers and simpler temporary fixes available. I always consider the easiest and safest path for pet owners.

### Ready-Made Wire Crate Dividers

Many dog crate manufacturers sell specific dividers for their crates. These are typically wire panels. They match the crate's design.
*   **Pros:** Perfect fit, easy installation, designed for safety.
*   **Cons:** Only fit specific crate brands/models, can be costly.
*   **Where to find:** Pet stores, online retailers (Amazon, Chewy), or the crate manufacturer's website.

### Tension Rod Dividers (for very temporary use)

For a very short-term solution, you might use a strong tension rod. This is not for chewers or active dogs. It is more of a visual barrier.
*   **Pros:** No damage to crate, easy to install and remove, very cheap.
*   **Cons:** Not secure, easily pushed over, not chew-proof.
*   **Use case:** Only for calm dogs who respect boundaries and do not chew.

### Custom Plastic Panels

Some companies offer custom-cut plastic panels. You provide the measurements. They cut the panel for you.
*   **Pros:** Precise fit, durable materials like HDPE or PVC, professional finish.
*   **Cons:** Can be expensive, requires accurate measurements from you.
*   **Where to find:** Online plastic suppliers, local sign shops.

### Cardboard Box or Thick Cardboard Sheets (Temporary, not recommended for puppies)

This is a very temporary solution. It is mostly for adult dogs who need a visual barrier. It will not stand up to chewing.
*   **Pros:** Free or very cheap, easy to cut.
*   **Cons:** Not durable, easily chewed, absorbs liquid, not safe for long-term use.
*   **Recommendation:** Use only if you have no other options and supervise your dog constantly. This is not suitable for puppies or active dogs.

Remember, the best solution provides security and comfort for your dog. For many people, [how many hours a day is it ok to crate a dog](https://cosyhomecreation.com/how-many-hours-a-day-is-it-ok-to-crate-a-dog) is a common question. A properly sized crate with a divider ensures that these hours are safe and comfortable. Choose an option that fits your dog's needs and your lifestyle.

## Safety Tips and Maintenance for Your DIY Crate Divider

Creating a safe environment for your dog is important. Your DIY crate divider needs to be secure and well-maintained. A safe divider protects your dog. It also makes crate training more effective.

First, check for sharp edges or splinters regularly. Even well-sanded wood can develop rough spots over time. Run your hand over all surfaces. If you find any, sand them smooth again. This prevents injuries to your dog. Dogs may rub against the divider or try to chew it.

Second, inspect the divider for damage. Look for chew marks or cracks. If your dog is a strong chewer, they might try to destroy the divider. Replace or repair any damaged parts immediately. A damaged divider can become a hazard. Consider applying a new coat of pet-safe sealant if the old one wears off.

Third, ensure the divider is always securely in place. Regularly test its stability. Push on it gently. It should not wobble or shift. If it moves, re-secure it. You can tighten screws or adjust attachments. A loose divider can fall over and scare or injure your dog.

Lastly, keep the divider clean. Just like the rest of the crate, it can get dirty. Wipe it down with pet-safe cleaner. This prevents odors and bacteria buildup. A clean crate is a healthy crate. Regular maintenance ensures your divider remains safe and functional for your dog's use.

## Ensuring Proper Crate Sizing with Your Divider

Proper crate sizing is the foundation of successful crate training. A divider helps you achieve this perfect fit as your puppy grows. It ensures your dog feels secure and makes progress with potty training.

When you first bring a puppy home, their bladder is small. They cannot hold it for long. A large crate gives them space to eliminate in one corner and sleep in another. This works against their natural instinct to keep their den clean. By using a divider, you limit their space. This forces them to hold their bladder until they are let out. It teaches them to associate the crate with a clean sleeping area. It helps with house training. Potty training is crucial for a new puppy. Using a divider can make teaching your dog [how to train your dog to use a bell to go outside](https://cosyhomecreation.com/how-to-train-your-dog-to-use-a-bell-to-go-outside) much easier.

As your puppy grows, you can adjust the divider. Move it back a few inches at a time. This gradually increases their living space. The goal is to always provide just enough room for them to stand up, turn around, and lie down comfortably. Never give them so much space that they can designate a "bathroom" area.

Monitor your dog's progress. If they have accidents in the crate, you might need to make the space smaller. If they seem cramped, give them a little more room. The divider should always make the crate a comfortable, safe den. It helps prevent accidents and encourages good habits. This makes the crate a positive place for your dog.

## Troubleshooting Common DIY Divider Issues

Making your own divider can sometimes present small challenges. Knowing how to fix them helps. I have encountered several common issues myself. Here are some solutions to help you.

### Divider Is Too Loose or Wobbles

If your divider moves around, it is not secure. This can be unsafe for your dog.
*   **Solution:** Re-measure your crate carefully. The divider needs a snug fit. If it's plywood, cut a slightly wider piece. For wire crates, use stronger L-brackets or U-bolts. Ensure they are tightened completely. You can also add non-slip pads to the bottom edges of the divider.

### Dog Chews the Divider

Puppies, especially, love to chew. A chewed divider is not only damaged but can also be a choking hazard.
*   **Solution:** Use a more durable material. If you used wood, switch to PVC or HDPE. These are harder to chew through. You can also apply bitter apple spray to the divider. This taste discourages chewing. Provide plenty of appropriate chew toys inside the crate. This redirects their chewing behavior.

### Divider Blocks Airflow

A solid divider can sometimes block air circulation. This makes the crate uncomfortable for your dog.
*   **Solution:** Ensure the divider does not go completely to the top or bottom of the crate. Leave a small gap (1-2 inches) at the top and bottom. This allows for some airflow. For very hot climates, consider a wire divider or a divider with small holes for ventilation. Always ensure your dog has adequate airflow.

### Difficulty Cleaning the Divider

Some materials are harder to clean than others. Plywood, if not sealed, can absorb odors.
*   **Solution:** Always seal wooden dividers with pet-safe, non-toxic sealant or paint. This makes the surface smooth and non-porous. Wipe down the divider regularly with pet-safe cleaning wipes or spray. For plastic dividers, a simple wipe-down is usually enough. Regular cleaning keeps the crate fresh.

Addressing these issues makes your DIY divider safer and more effective. It helps ensure your dog has a positive crate experience.

## Conclusion

Creating a divider for your dog crate is a smart and practical project. It ensures your puppy has the perfect den size. This makes crate training easier and more effective. A well-fitted crate helps with potty training. It also provides a secure space for your growing dog. You can make a divider using materials like plywood or PVC.
