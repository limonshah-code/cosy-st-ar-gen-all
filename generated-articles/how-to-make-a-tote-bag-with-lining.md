## How to Make a Tote Bag with Lining: A Step-by-Step Guide

Have you ever wanted a bag that perfectly fits your style and needs? A handmade tote bag offers endless possibilities for personalization. Adding a lining makes your tote durable and organized. It gives your bag a polished, professional look. I believe creating your own accessories brings joy and practical benefits.

Making a tote bag with lining might seem hard at first. But I am here to guide you through each step. This article will show you how to choose materials, cut fabric, and sew everything together. We will cover preparing the main bag, creating a neat lining, and combining the two for a perfect finish. By the end, you will have a unique, sturdy tote bag. You can use it for groceries, books, or daily essentials. Get ready to transform fabric into a beautiful, functional item.

### Takeaway

*   **Select Quality Materials:** Choose durable outer fabric and a complementary lining.
*   **Accurate Cutting is Key:** Measure and cut fabric pieces precisely for a clean finish.
*   **Sew with Care:** Use proper seam allowances and pressing techniques.
*   **Box Corners for Structure:** Create a flat bottom for your tote bag.
*   **Add Inner Pockets:** Enhance functionality with well-placed pockets inside the lining.
*   **Attach Handles Securely:** Reinforce handle stitching for long-lasting use.
*   **Finish Neatly:** Topstitch around the opening for a professional appearance.

You can make a tote bag with lining by cutting fabric pieces for the outer bag and lining, sewing them separately, adding handles to the outer bag, and then joining the outer bag and lining right sides together before turning and topstitching for a clean finish. This process creates a sturdy, functional, and attractive bag.

### The Charm of a Lined Tote Bag: Why Make One?

Imagine carrying a bag that truly reflects your personality. A handmade tote bag offers this unique opportunity. It stands out from mass-produced items. Making your own bag also ensures quality and durability. You control the fabrics and the stitching.

Adding a lining takes your tote to the next level. The lining protects the outer fabric from wear and tear. It also gives the inside of your bag a clean, finished look. Without a lining, seams might fray, and the bag's shape could sag. A lined tote feels more substantial and professional.

Beyond aesthetics, a lining offers practical benefits. It can hide raw seams, making the bag's interior neat. You can also add pockets to the lining for better organization. This keeps your keys, phone, and wallet easily accessible. A well-made, lined tote bag lasts for years. It becomes a reliable companion for all your adventures. This project gives you a useful item and a sense of accomplishment.

### Gathering Your Sewing Essentials: Tools and Materials

Before you begin sewing, gather all your necessary tools and materials. Having everything ready makes the process smooth and enjoyable. This step prevents interruptions and keeps your workflow consistent. I always lay out my supplies beforehand. This ensures I have enough fabric and the right notions.

**Essential Tools:**

*   **Sewing Machine:** A basic machine works well for tote bags. Make sure it is threaded and in good working order.
*   **Fabric Scissors:** Use sharp scissors only for fabric to keep them keen. Dull scissors can fray edges and make cutting harder.
*   **Iron and Ironing Board:** Pressing seams flat is crucial for a professional finish. It makes your work look crisp.
*   **Pins or Fabric Clips:** These hold fabric pieces together before sewing. They prevent shifting.
*   **Measuring Tape or Ruler:** Accurate measurements are key to a well-fitting bag.
*   **Fabric Marking Tool:** A tailor's chalk or disappearing ink pen helps mark cutting lines and darts.
*   **Seam Ripper:** Mistakes happen, and a seam ripper helps correct them neatly.
*   **Matching Thread:** Choose good quality polyester thread that matches your fabric colors.

**Materials You Will Need:**

*   **Outer Fabric:** Pick a durable fabric like canvas, duck cloth, denim, or even a sturdy home decor fabric. Consider something that holds its shape. You will need about 1 yard, depending on bag size.
*   **Lining Fabric:** Choose a lighter weight fabric like cotton quilting fabric. It should complement your outer fabric. You will need about 1 yard.
*   **Interfacing (Optional but Recommended):** Medium-weight fusible interfacing adds structure and body. It makes your bag stand up nicely.
*   **Webbing or Fabric for Handles:** You can use pre-made cotton webbing or cut fabric strips from your outer fabric. You will need about 1.5 to 2 yards for two handles.

Gathering these items first ensures you are ready to create your beautiful tote bag. It sets the stage for a successful sewing project.

### Prepping Your Fabric: Cutting and Ironing for Success

Accurate fabric preparation is the foundation of a well-made bag. Taking your time with this step prevents issues later on. Cutting fabric incorrectly can lead to crooked seams and an uneven bag. I always double-check my measurements before making the first cut. This attention to detail saves time and frustration.

**Washing and Ironing Fabric:**
First, wash and dry your outer and lining fabrics. This preshrinks the fabric. It prevents your finished bag from shrinking later. After washing, iron all your fabric pieces smooth. Wrinkles can distort your cuts and seams. A smooth fabric surface ensures precision.

**Determining Bag Dimensions:**
Decide on the size of your tote bag. A common size for a versatile tote might be 16 inches wide by 14 inches tall. For this example, let us use these dimensions. Remember to add seam allowance to all measurements. A standard seam allowance is 1/2 inch.

**Cutting the Fabric Pieces:**
Based on your desired bag dimensions and chosen seam allowance, cut the following pieces:

*   **Outer Bag:**
    *   Cut two rectangles for the main body. For a 16x14 inch bag with 1/2 inch seam allowance, cut each piece 17 inches wide by 15 inches tall (16 + 1" for width, 14 + 1" for height).
*   **Lining Fabric:**
    *   Cut two rectangles for the main lining. Use the same dimensions as the outer bag: 17 inches wide by 15 inches tall.
    *   **(Optional) Inner Pocket:** Cut one rectangle for an inner pocket. A good size is 10 inches wide by 14 inches tall. You will fold this in half later.
*   **Interfacing (if using):**
    *   Cut two pieces for the outer bag, slightly smaller than the outer fabric pieces. About 16 inches wide by 14 inches tall.
    *   Cut one piece for the inner pocket, same size as the pocket piece (10 inches wide by 14 inches tall).
*   **Handles:**
    *   If using fabric handles, cut two strips. Each strip should be 4 inches wide by 24 inches long. Adjust length as desired. If using webbing, cut two pieces 24 inches long.

**Applying Interfacing (if using):**
Place the fusible interfacing pieces onto the wrong side of your outer bag fabric pieces. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for ironing. The heat will bond the interfacing to the fabric. This gives your bag structure. Also, apply interfacing to your pocket piece if desired. Proper fabric preparation makes the rest of your sewing project much easier and more enjoyable.

### Constructing the Outer Bag: Sewing the Main Body

Now that your fabric is cut and prepped, it is time to assemble the main structure of your tote bag. This involves sewing the side seams and creating the flat bottom. I find this stage exciting as the bag starts to take shape. Work carefully here to ensure a strong and well-formed bag.

**Step 1: Prepare the Outer Fabric Pieces**
Take your two outer bag fabric pieces. Place them right sides together, aligning all edges. Pin along the sides and the bottom edge. Leave the top edge open. Use plenty of pins to keep the fabric from shifting as you sew.

**Step 2: Sew the Side and Bottom Seams**
Using your sewing machine, sew along the pinned side seams and the bottom seam. Use a 1/2-inch seam allowance. Backstitch at the beginning and end of each seam. This secures the stitches. This step creates a bag tube. I like to use a slightly longer stitch length for heavier fabrics. This helps prevent skipped stitches.

**Step 3: Press the Seams Open**
Carefully press all the seams you just sewed. Pressing seams open creates a flatter, less bulky finish. It helps the bag lie smoothly. Use a hot iron. This step is important for a professional look.

**Step 4: Create Boxed Corners (for a flat bottom)**
Boxed corners give your tote a flat, structured bottom. This makes the bag stand up on its own. It is a simple technique but makes a big difference.

*   First, flatten one corner of your bag. Align the side seam with the bottom seam. This forms a triangle.
*   Measure from the point of the triangle inwards. Mark a line perpendicular to the seam. For a common tote, a 2-inch measurement creates a 4-inch wide boxed corner. So, mark a line 2 inches from the corner point. This line should be 4 inches long.
*   Pin along this marked line.
*   Sew directly on the marked line. Backstitch well at both ends.
*   Repeat this process for the other bottom corner.
*   Trim the excess fabric from the boxed corners, leaving a 1/2-inch seam allowance. This reduces bulk.

Your outer bag now has a distinct shape. The boxed corners give it stability. Set the outer bag aside. You will now move on to preparing the lining.

### Crafting the Lining: The Inside Story

The lining provides a clean interior and enhances the bag's functionality. Just like the outer bag, it needs precise construction. I enjoy adding a pocket in this section. It makes the tote even more useful for daily items.

**Step 1: Prepare the Lining Fabric Pieces**
Take your two lining fabric pieces. If you are adding an inner pocket, grab that piece too.

**Step 2: Create the Inner Pocket (Optional but Recommended)**
An inner pocket is perfect for small items.
*   Take your pocket fabric piece (e.g., 10 inches x 14 inches).
*   Fold it in half lengthwise, wrong sides together, so it measures 10 inches x 7 inches. Press the fold.
*   Open the fabric. Fold each long edge towards the center fold by 1/2 inch and press. Then, fold the short edges towards the center fold by 1/2 inch and press.
*   Fold the fabric in half again, right sides together, matching the raw edges. Sew the two side seams, using a 1/2-inch seam allowance. Leave a 2-inch opening along one side seam for turning.
*   Clip the corners. Turn the pocket right side out through the opening. Push out the corners neatly. Press flat.
*   Topstitch along the top edge of the pocket. This creates a finished opening.
*   Center the pocket on one lining piece, about 3-4 inches down from the top edge. Pin it in place.
*   Sew the pocket onto the lining piece. Stitch along the sides and bottom edge. Backstitch at the beginning and end. Be sure to close the opening you left for turning. You can sew a vertical line down the middle of the pocket to create two smaller compartments if you wish.

**Step 3: Assemble the Lining Bag**
Place the two main lining fabric pieces right sides together. Align all edges. Pin along the sides and the bottom edge, just like you did for the outer bag. Leave the top edge open.

**Step 4: Sew Lining Side and Bottom Seams**
Sew the side and bottom seams of the lining using a 1/2-inch seam allowance. Remember to backstitch. This forms the lining bag tube.

**Step 5: Press Lining Seams Open**
Press all seams open to reduce bulk and create a smooth interior.

**Step 6: Create Boxed Corners for the Lining**
Repeat the same boxed corner technique you used for the outer bag. Align side and bottom seams, measure, mark, and sew your 2-inch lines. Trim excess fabric. This ensures your lining fits perfectly inside the outer bag.

The lining is now ready. It mirrors the outer bag's shape. You can appreciate how the pocket makes it even more functional.

### Attaching the Handles: Secure and Stylish

Handles are crucial for any tote bag. They must be strong enough to carry your items. Proper attachment ensures durability and comfort. I often reinforce my handles with extra stitching for peace of mind. This step gives your bag its carrying ability.

**Option 1: Fabric Handles**

*   **Prepare Fabric Strips:** If you cut fabric strips for your handles (e.g., 4 inches wide by 24 inches long), press each strip. Fold each long edge in by 1/2 inch and press. Then fold the strip in half lengthwise and press again. This creates a neat, four-layer strap.
*   **Topstitch Handles:** Sew along both long edges of each folded handle strip, close to the edge. This secures the folds and gives a finished look.
*   **Attach to Outer Bag:** Take your outer bag. Decide where you want the handles. A common placement is 3-4 inches in from each side seam on the top raw edge. Pin the raw ends of each handle to the right side of the outer bag's top edge. Ensure the handles are not twisted.
*   **Sew Handles in Place:** Stitch the handles to the outer bag using a 1/4-inch seam allowance. Go back and forth several times over the handle ends. This reinforces the attachment. This stitching will be hidden later.

**Option 2: Webbing Handles**

*   **Prepare Webbing:** If using pre-made webbing, simply cut to your desired length (e.g., 24 inches).
*   **Attach to Outer Bag:** Place the ends of the webbing straps onto the right side of the outer bag's top edge. Position them 3-4 inches in from the side seams. Pin securely. Ensure the webbing is not twisted.
*   **Sew Handles in Place:** Stitch the webbing to the outer bag with a 1/4-inch seam allowance. Sew back and forth multiple times, creating a strong attachment. I often sew a box or an "X" pattern for extra strength. This prevents the handles from ripping off, especially if you carry heavy items.

Make sure your handles are securely fastened. They bear the weight of everything inside your tote. Once the handles are attached, your outer bag is almost complete. Now comes the exciting part of combining the two main pieces.

### Bringing It All Together: Joining Outer and Lining

This is where your tote bag truly comes to life. Joining the outer bag and the lining requires careful alignment. This step seals the raw edges inside, creating a professional and durable finish. I enjoy this part because it is when I see the bag becoming a whole item.

**Step 1: Prepare for Joining**
Turn the outer bag right side out. The handles should be pointing upwards. Take the lining bag and leave it wrong side out.

**Step 2: Insert Lining into Outer Bag**
Carefully insert the lining bag into the outer bag. The right side of the outer bag should be facing the right side of the lining bag. Align the side seams of the outer bag with the side seams of the lining bag. This ensures the bag hangs straight. Nest these seams together.

**Step 3: Pin the Top Edges**
Align the raw top edges of the outer bag and the lining bag. Pin all around the opening. Make sure the handles are tucked down inside the bag between the outer fabric and lining. Leave a 4-5 inch opening along one side of the top edge. This opening is crucial for turning the bag right side out later.

**Step 4: Sew the Top Edge**
Using a 1/2-inch seam allowance, sew all around the pinned top edge. Start sewing a few inches before your marked opening and end a few inches after it. Remember to backstitch at the beginning and end of your stitching. Do not sew over the opening. This seam connects the outer bag and the lining.

**Step 5: Turn the Bag Right Side Out**
Reach into the opening you left on the top edge. Gently pull the entire bag through this opening. It might feel a bit awkward at first. Take your time to carefully pull all the fabric through until the bag is completely right side out. Push out the corners of the bag bottom using your fingers or a blunt tool.

**Step 6: Press the Top Edge**
Once the bag is right side out, push the lining down into the outer bag. Smooth out the top edge of the bag. Press the entire top opening with an iron. Make sure the seam where you joined the outer and lining fabrics is perfectly aligned and pressed flat. Press the raw edges of the opening inwards so they align with the seam. This creates a neat, unstitched edge.

**Step 7: Topstitch the Opening**
Topstitch around the entire top opening of the bag, very close to the edge (about 1/8 to 1/4 inch from the folded edge). This topstitching serves two purposes: it closes the opening you used for turning, and it gives your bag a professional, crisp finish. It also adds durability to the bag's opening. Your tote bag is now fully assembled and looks fantastic.

### Caring for Your Handmade Tote: Maintenance Tips

You have invested time and effort into making your beautiful tote bag. Proper care ensures it lasts for years. Good maintenance keeps your bag looking fresh and new. I always follow these simple steps to protect my handmade items.

**Cleaning Your Tote Bag:**
*   **Spot Cleaning:** For small spills or dirt, try to spot clean first. Use a damp cloth with a mild soap. Gently dab the stained area. Avoid rubbing too hard, as this can spread the stain.
*   **Machine Washing (if fabric allows):** If your fabric is machine washable, you can wash the entire bag. Use cold water on a delicate cycle. Place the bag in a mesh laundry bag to protect it. This prevents tangling or damage.
*   **Hand Washing:** For more delicate fabrics, hand washing is a safer option. Fill a basin with cool water and a small amount of mild detergent. Submerge the bag and gently agitate. Rinse thoroughly until no soap remains.
*   **Avoid Harsh Chemicals:** Do not use bleach or strong cleaning agents. These can damage fabric colors and fibers. For specific advice on cleaning different types of bags, you can refer to resources like [how to clean coach bag](https://cosyhomecreation.com/how-to-clean-coach-bag).

**Drying Your Tote Bag:**
*   **Air Dry:** Always air dry your tote bag. Lay it flat on a clean surface or hang it to dry. Avoid direct sunlight, as it can fade fabric colors.
*   **Reshape While Drying:** Gently reshape the bag while it is still damp. This helps it retain its original form. Stuff it with clean towels if needed to maintain its shape.

**Storage Tips:**
*   **Store Flat or Stuffed:** Store your tote bag flat when not in use. If you want to maintain its shape, stuff it with tissue paper or soft cloths. This prevents creases and sagging.
*   **Avoid Overstuffing:** Do not consistently overstuff your tote bag. This can strain seams and handles over time.
*   **Protect from Dust:** Store your bag in a dust bag or pillowcase. This protects it from dust and light exposure.

Following these care tips will help preserve the beauty and longevity of your handmade tote bag. You can enjoy using it for many years to come.

### FAQs About Making a Tote Bag

**Q1: What is the best fabric for a durable tote bag?**
The best fabrics for a durable tote bag are heavy-duty options. Canvas, duck cloth, and denim work very well. These materials hold their shape and withstand daily use. For the lining, choose a lighter weight cotton fabric. This keeps the inside neat without adding too much bulk.

**Q2: Can I make this tote bag without a sewing machine?**
Yes, you can make a tote bag without a sewing machine. Hand sewing requires patience and a good thimble. Use strong thread and short, even stitches for durability. It will take longer than machine sewing, but the result can be equally beautiful and sturdy.

**Q3: How do I add pockets to my tote bag lining?**
To add pockets, cut fabric rectangles for your desired pocket size. Hem the top edge. Fold and press the other three edges under. Pin the pocket onto the lining piece where you want it. Stitch around the three folded edges to secure the pocket. You can also add vertical stitching for multiple compartments.

**Q4: What is seam allowance, and why is it important?**
Seam allowance is the distance between your stitching line and the raw edge of the fabric. It is important for consistency in your sewing. Using a consistent seam allowance, like 1/2 inch, ensures your bag pieces fit together correctly. It also contributes to the final dimensions and shape of your project.

**Q5: How can I make my tote bag stand up on its own?**
To make your tote bag stand up on its own, use medium-to-heavy weight fusible interfacing on your outer fabric pieces. Also, make sure to create "boxed corners" at the bottom of both your outer bag and your lining. These techniques add structure and a flat base, helping the bag maintain its shape.

**Q6: What if my fabric frays a lot during sewing?**
If your fabric frays a lot, you can finish the raw edges. Options include using a serger if you have one. You can also use a
