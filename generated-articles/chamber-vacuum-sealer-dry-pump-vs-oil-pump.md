## Understanding Chamber Vacuum Sealer Pumps

Chamber vacuum sealers operate by creating a vacuum inside an entire chamber, not just around the bag opening. This design allows them to seal liquids, marinades, and delicate foods without crushing them. The efficiency and power of this vacuum rely entirely on the type of pump inside the machine. These pumps draw air out of the chamber, creating the low-pressure environment needed for effective sealing.

The two main pump technologies are dry pumps and oil pumps. Each type uses a different mechanism to remove air, leading to distinct performance characteristics. Knowing how each works helps you understand why one might be better for your needs than the other. This foundational knowledge simplifies your purchasing decision. Both pump types aim for the same goal: preserving food effectively.

### What is a Dry Pump?

A dry pump operates without any lubricating oil. These pumps typically use internal components, like a piston or diaphragm, to create the vacuum. Their design means they do not require oil changes or filters. This simplicity contributes to their ease of use. Dry pumps are often seen in entry-level or mid-range chamber sealers.

The absence of oil makes them cleaner to operate. There is no risk of oil leaks or spills. This also means less ongoing maintenance effort. Dry pumps are a popular choice for many home users.
