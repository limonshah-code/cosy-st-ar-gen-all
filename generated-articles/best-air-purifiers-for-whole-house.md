## Types of Whole House Air Purifier Systems

Whole house air purifiers use different technologies to clean the air. Each type targets specific pollutants. Understanding these differences helps you choose the right system for your home. You can select the best option for your family's needs.

### Media Filters

These are the most common type. They use thick filters to trap particles. Filter effectiveness is measured by the MERV (Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value) rating. A higher MERV rating means better filtration. MERV 8 filters capture pollen, dust mites, and mold spores. MERV 11-13 filters are good for pet dander and fine dust.
