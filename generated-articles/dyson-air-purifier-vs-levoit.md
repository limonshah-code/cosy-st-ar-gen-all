The heart of any air purifier is its filtration system. Both Dyson and Levoit use advanced filters. These filters capture various airborne particles. They aim to improve indoor air quality. Their approaches to filter integration and sealing differ. This affects overall purification efficiency.

### Dyson's Sealed Filtration System

Dyson purifiers use a fully sealed filtration system. This means the entire unit is sealed. It prevents dirty air from bypassing the filters. The system captures 99.97% of particles. These particles are as small as 0.3 microns. This includes allergens, pollen, and pet dander. Dyson units also feature activated carbon filters. These filters remove gases, odors, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The sealed system ensures that once pollutants are captured, they stay captured. My understanding is this design enhances overall purification. It prevents leakage. This is a crucial aspect for people with severe allergies or asthma. Dyson provides clear instructions on [how often to change your Dyson air purifier filter](https://cosyhomecreation.com/dyson-air-purifier-filter-how-often). Regular replacement keeps the system efficient.

### Levoit's Multi-Stage Filtration

Levoit purifiers typically employ a 3-stage filtration system. This system includes a pre-filter. The pre-filter captures large particles like dust and pet hair. It extends the life of other filters. The second stage is a True HEPA filter. This filter captures 99.97% of particles 0.3 microns in size. This includes mold spores, pet dander, and pollen. For specific concerns like mold, knowing the [best Levoit air purifier for mold](https://cosyhomecreation.com/best-levoit-air-purifier-for-mold) helps. The third stage is an activated carbon filter.

Dyson purifiers connect to the Dyson Link app. This app offers remote control. It also provides real-time air quality reports. The app tracks pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, VOCs, and NO2. For example, selecting the [best Dyson air purifier for bedroom](https://cosyhomecreation.com/best-dyson-air-purifier-for-bedroom) often involves considering its design and quiet operation for sleep. Dyson devices automatically adjust fan speed based on air quality. This provides continuous purification. Their intelligent sensors are a key advantage.

For a large area, finding the [best Levoit air purifier for large room](https://cosyhomecreation.com/best-levoit-air-purifier-for-large-room) means checking its CADR and smart features. Levoit's approach is about delivering essential smart features without unnecessary frills.

## Performance Metrics: CADR, Coverage, and Noise Levels

When choosing an air purifier, performance metrics are critical. Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) indicates how quickly a purifier cleans a room. Coverage area specifies the room size it can handle.

They also maintain relatively quiet operation. In night mode, many Dyson models are very quiet. This makes them suitable for bedrooms. For example, considering the [best Dyson air purifier for large room](https://cosyhomecreation.com/best-dyson-air-purifier-for-large-room) involves balancing high CADR with acceptable noise levels.
