This system ensures that air passes through filters, trapping harmful particles and gases. Knowing how Dyson air purifiers operate helps understand their value. You can read more about [how Dyson air purifiers work](https://cosyhomecreation.com/dyson-air-purifier-how-it-works) to get a full picture.

The main job of these machines is to remove invisible pollutants. This includes allergens, pollen, mold spores, and pet dander. They also capture odors and gases. Both the TP07 and TP09 have a sealed HEPA and activated carbon filter system. The HEPA filter captures 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns. The activated carbon layer removes gases, odors, and VOCs (volatile organic compounds). This dual-layer filtration is standard across many Dyson purifiers. It ensures a high level of air cleanliness for general pollutants.

## Filtration System: The Core of Clean Air

The filtration system is the most important part of any air purifier. It determines what pollutants the machine can remove. Both the Dyson TP07 and TP09 use a sealed HEPA and activated carbon filter. This combination is powerful. It captures a wide range of airborne contaminants.

The HEPA filter inside these machines traps tiny particles. These include pollen, dust mites, pet dander, and bacteria. It ensures that 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns are removed. This is crucial for people with allergies or asthma. The activated carbon layer works on gases and odors. It absorbs harmful chemicals like benzene and nitrogen dioxide. It also removes unpleasant smells from cooking or pets. This two-stage filtration provides clean air.

### The TP09's Unique Formaldehyde Filtration

The Dyson TP09 has a significant advantage in its filtration system. It includes an extra, dedicated catalytic filter. This filter specifically targets formaldehyde. Formaldehyde is a common indoor pollutant. It comes from furniture, paint, cleaning products, and building materials. Exposure to formaldehyde can cause irritation. It may lead to more serious health issues over time.

The catalytic filter in the TP09 works differently. It does not just trap formaldehyde. It continuously destroys it. The filter converts formaldehyde into harmless water and carbon dioxide molecules. This means the filter does not saturate with formaldehyde. It does not need replacement due to formaldehyde buildup. This is a unique feature. The TP07 does not have this catalytic filter. It relies only on its activated carbon filter for gases. While activated carbon can absorb some formaldehyde, it gets saturated. This means it stops working effectively over time. The TP09 offers a permanent solution for formaldehyde removal.

### Filter Maintenance and Lifespan

Both the TP07 and TP09 require filter replacement. The HEPA and activated carbon filters need changing. Dyson recommends changing these filters once every 12 months. This is based on 12 hours of daily use. Your filter life may vary. It depends on your home's air quality and how often you use the purifier. The Dyson Link app will notify you when it is time to change the filter.

I always recommend checking the app for filter life. Changing filters on time ensures the machine works best. You can learn more about [Dyson air purifier filter change frequency](https://cosyhomecreation.com/dyson-air-purifier-filter-change-how-often) to plan your maintenance.

Both models have intelligent sensors. These sensors detect airborne particles and gases. They measure PM2.5 and PM10 levels. These are fine particulate matters. They also detect VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds). The machine then adjusts its fan speed automatically. This ensures your air quality remains good. The LCD screen on the device shows these readings. It provides a visual display of current air quality. This display changes color based on pollution levels.

### TP09's Formaldehyde Sensor Advantage

The Dyson TP09 includes an additional sensor. This sensor specifically detects formaldehyde. It is a precise solid-state formaldehyde sensor. This sensor is important. Formaldehyde is a tricky pollutant to detect. It can off-gas from materials for many years. The TP07 does not have this dedicated sensor. It can only detect general VOCs. This means it may not accurately show formaldehyde levels.

The TP09's formaldehyde sensor allows for precise monitoring. It gives you a clear picture of this specific pollutant. This is a key difference. If you worry about formaldehyde, the TP09 offers peace of mind. It can tell you if formaldehyde is present. It then works to destroy it. This level of detail in air quality reporting is a significant upgrade.
