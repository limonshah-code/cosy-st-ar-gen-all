## Spotting the Difference: Husky vs. Malamute Puppy Traits

Many people confuse Husky puppies and Malamute puppies. Both breeds descend from Arctic sled dogs. They share a striking resemblance, especially when they are young. However, distinct characteristics set them apart. This guide helps you identify these differences. We will look at their physical features, temperament, and care needs. Understanding these traits helps you choose the right puppy for your home. It also ensures you provide the best care for your new furry friend.

### Takeaway

Distinguishing a Husky puppy from a Malamute puppy involves observing several key traits:

*   **Size & Build:** Malamutes are larger, heavier, and more powerfully built. Huskies are smaller and more athletic.
*   **Head & Face:** Huskies often have blue eyes and a more pointed muzzle. Malamutes typically have brown eyes and a broader head.
*   **Coat:** Malamute fur is thicker and coarser. Husky fur is slightly softer and more sleek.
*   **Tail:** Malamute tails curl over their back like a plume. Husky tails have a sickle shape.
*   **Temperament:** Huskies are highly energetic and social. Malamutes are independent and strong-willed.

### Clear Answer

To tell the difference between a Husky and a Malamute puppy, observe their size, build, and facial features. Malamute puppies are typically larger, stockier, and have broader heads with brown eyes and plumed tails. Husky puppies are smaller, more athletic, often have blue eyes, and possess more pointed muzzles with sickle-shaped tails.

## Physical Traits: Size and Build of Husky vs. Malamute Puppies

When you first see a Husky and a Malamute puppy, their size is often the first clue. Alaskan Malamutes are larger and heavier dogs. They have a powerful, substantial build. Their bone structure is denser than a Husky's.

Siberian Huskies are medium-sized dogs. They have a more compact and athletic build. Huskies appear lighter on their feet compared to Malamutes. Malamute puppies usually start out a bit bigger than Husky puppies at the same age.

For example, at eight weeks, a Malamute puppy might weigh between 15-25 pounds. A Husky puppy of the same age typically weighs 10-15 pounds. This weight difference becomes more noticeable as they grow. Adult male Malamutes can weigh 85-100 pounds. Adult male Huskies usually weigh 45-60 pounds.

Malamutes also have a broader chest and deeper body. This gives them a more formidable appearance. Huskies are leaner, showing a more graceful profile. Their size difference is important to consider for living space and exercise needs. A larger dog needs more room.

Puppy growth rates vary slightly between breeds. Malamutes mature slower than Huskies. A Malamute puppy might take two years to reach full physical maturity. Huskies often reach their full size by 12-18 months. Their build shows their original purpose. Malamutes pulled heavy loads over long distances. Huskies pulled lighter loads quickly.

This tells you about their inherent strength and agility.

## Head and Facial Features: Ears, Eyes, and Muzzles

The differences in their heads and faces are crucial for identification. These details are often visible even in young puppies. Pay close attention to their eyes, ears, and muzzle shape. These features provide clear indicators of their breed.

### Eyes: Color and Shape

Siberian Huskies are famous for their eye colors. Many Huskies have striking blue eyes. They can also have brown eyes, or even one blue and one brown eye (heterochromia). This is a common and accepted trait for the breed. Their eyes are almond-shaped and set slightly obliquely. This gives them an alert expression.

Alaskan Malamutes almost always have brown eyes. Their breed standard does not allow blue eyes. If a puppy has blue eyes, it is most likely a Husky or a Husky mix. Malamute eyes are typically dark brown and almond-shaped. They have a gentle yet keen look. The absence of blue eyes is a strong clue for a Malamute.

### Ears: Size and Placement

Husky puppies have medium-sized ears. Their ears are triangular and set fairly high on their heads. They stand erect and are close together. This ear placement contributes to their alert and intelligent appearance. The ears are also well-furred inside.

Malamute puppies have smaller ears in proportion to their large heads. Their ears are also triangular but set wider apart. They stand erect but are not as high on the head as a Husky's. Malamute ears are thicker and heavily furred. This protects them from harsh cold. The ear size and set contribute to their powerful, bear-like facial structure.

### Muzzle and Skull Shape

Husky puppies have a medium-length muzzle. It tapers to a point, but it is not sharp. Their skull is rounded. The stop, the area between the eyes, is clearly defined. This gives their face a more refined look.

Malamute puppies have a broad and deep muzzle. It is not pointed. Their skull is broad and moderately rounded. The stop is shallow. This facial structure reflects their strength. Their strong jaw is made for pulling. Their overall head appears more massive and powerful than a Husky's. Observing these subtle facial differences helps identify the correct breed.

## Coat Characteristics: Fur Type and Color Patterns

Both Huskies and Malamutes have dense double coats. This coat protected them from extreme Arctic weather. However, there are differences in their fur texture and common color patterns. These distinctions can help you tell the two breeds apart, even as puppies.

### Fur Texture and Thickness

Alaskan Malamutes have a thicker, coarser outer coat. Their undercoat is very dense and woolly. This provides excellent insulation. When you feel a Malamute puppy's fur, it feels more robust and perhaps a bit shaggy. Their fur stands off the body. This creates a fluffy appearance. Their coat is designed for extreme cold and is not waterproof.

Siberian Huskies have a medium-length double coat. Their outer coat is softer and smoother than a Malamute's. Their undercoat is also dense. However, it is not as thick or woolly as a Malamute's. A Husky puppy's fur feels sleek and less bulky. It lies closer to the body. Both breeds shed a lot, especially twice a year. Using a good [pet grooming vacuum for Husky](https://cosyhomecreation.com/best-pet-grooming-vacuum-for-husky) can help manage the shedding. The Malamute's coat requires more rigorous grooming due to its thickness.

### Common Color Patterns and Markings

Husky puppies come in a wide variety of colors. These include black and white, gray and white, red and white, and pure white. They often display distinctive facial markings. These can be masks, goggles, or "eyebrows" over their eyes. These markings give each Husky a unique look. They contribute to their appeal.

Malamute puppies typically come in fewer color combinations. Common colors include various shades of gray and white, black and white, sable and white, or red and white. They usually have a more uniform coat color over their body. Their facial markings are less elaborate. They often have a "cap" over their head. This cap does not extend to their eyes. They may have a prominent "bar" or stripe down their forehead. The lack of intricate facial masks often distinguishes them from Huskies.

## Tail and Gait: Unique Identifiers in Motion

Beyond their static features, how a Husky or Malamute puppy carries its tail and moves can also provide clues. These dynamic traits reflect their breeding and original purpose. Observing their tail carriage and gait gives a more complete picture of their identity.

### Tail Carriage and Shape

The tail is one of the most reliable ways to distinguish the two breeds. Alaskan Malamutes carry their tails over their back. It forms a graceful, bushy plume. The tail does not curl tightly. Instead, it waves or curls loosely like a plume. It is often described as a "waving plume" tail. The fur on the tail is very thick and bushy. This gives it a soft, feathery appearance. It is a defining characteristic of the Malamute.

Siberian Huskies typically carry their tails in a "sickle" curve. The tail curls up over their back but does not necessarily touch it. It usually hangs down when the dog is relaxed. When alert or moving, it curls up in an arc, resembling a sickle. The Husky tail is not as heavily plumed as a Malamute's. It is well-furred, but it is not as bushy. A tightly curled tail that rests against the back or curls like a "cinnamon bun" is generally not typical for a purebred Husky.

### Gait and Movement

The way these puppies move reflects their physical differences and original roles. Alaskan Malamutes have a powerful, steady gait. Their movement shows strength and endurance. They are built for pulling heavy loads over long distances. Their stride is purposeful and efficient. They move with a proud bearing. Their heavier build means they do not move with the same lightness as a Husky. Their paws are also larger and more robust.

Siberian Huskies move with a lighter, more agile gait. Their movement is fluid and graceful. They are built for speed and endurance over long distances with lighter loads. Their trot is effortless and appears tireless. They are known for their ability to cover ground quickly. Their paws are slightly smaller and more oval-shaped than a Malamute's. They often appear to glide over the ground. Observing these movement patterns can reveal their breed, even in puppyhood.

## Temperament and Behavior: Puppy Personalities

Beyond physical appearance, the personality traits of Husky and Malamute puppies vary. Both breeds are intelligent and can be strong-willed. Understanding their typical temperaments helps you prepare for their needs. It also helps you decide which breed fits your lifestyle better.

### Energy Levels and Playfulness

Siberian Huskies are known for their high energy levels. They are very active and playful puppies. They need a lot of exercise to stay happy and healthy. If a Husky puppy does not get enough physical activity, it can become destructive. They enjoy running, playing fetch, and exploring. They are often described as mischievous. Their high energy means they are not ideal for sedentary lifestyles. They thrive in active households.

Alaskan Malamutes are also energetic, but their energy is different. They have a powerful, sustained energy for endurance. They prefer long walks or hikes over high-speed running bursts. Malamute puppies are playful but can be less rambunctious than Huskies. They mature slower and may retain puppy-like behaviors longer. While they need exercise, their activity levels are often more moderate than a Husky's. They are built for strength and stamina, not necessarily speed.

### Independence and Trainability

Malamutes are often more independent and stubborn. They are very intelligent, but they have a mind of their own. Training a Malamute puppy requires patience, consistency, and a firm hand. They respond well to positive reinforcement. However, they may not always obey commands if they do not see the point. Their independence stems from their history as working dogs. They often made their own decisions in harsh conditions. For a comparison on training other breeds, consider [how to tell if my dog is a German Shepherd or a Belgian Malinois](https://cosyhomecreation.com/how-to-tell-if-my-dog-is-a-german-shepherd-or-a-belgian-malinois), which also explores behavioral traits.

Huskies are also intelligent but can be more eager to please, although they have a mischievous streak. They are known for their strong pack drive. This makes them highly social. Training a Husky puppy can be challenging due to their distractibility and high energy. They need early socialization and consistent training. Huskies respond well to fun, engaging training sessions. They get bored easily with repetitive tasks. Both breeds need clear boundaries and consistent training from a young age.

### Social Needs and Vocalizations

Huskies are highly social dogs. They thrive on companionship and do not do well when left alone for long periods. They are prone to separation anxiety if isolated. Huskies are known for their vocalizations. They rarely bark. Instead, they howl, "talk," and make other unique sounds. These vocalizations are part of their charm. They are excellent family dogs and generally good with children.

Malamutes are also social but can be more reserved with strangers. They form strong bonds with their families. They are loyal and affectionate companions. Like Huskies, Malamutes are not big barkers. They are more likely to "woo-woo" or make deep, guttural sounds. They are less prone to howling than Huskies. Malamutes can be very gentle with children. However, their size and strength mean supervision is always necessary. They may also exhibit a strong prey drive.

## Growth and Development: Milestones and Maturity

Understanding the growth patterns of Husky and Malamute puppies helps in identification. It also helps in predicting their adult size and needs. These two breeds follow different developmental timelines. This affects their appearance and behavior at various stages.

### Puppyhood Milestones

Both Husky and Malamute puppies grow rapidly in their first few months. However, the Malamute puppy will generally reach higher weights at the same age. For instance, at 4 months old, a Malamute puppy might already be around 35-45 pounds. A Husky puppy of the same age would likely be in the 25-35 pound range. These are averages, of course, but the trend holds. Malamutes have a more significant overall growth spurt.

Their bone structure also develops differently. Malamutes will show thicker bones and a more robust frame earlier. Huskies will appear more slender and athletic for longer. By six months, a Malamute puppy will look much more substantial than a Husky puppy. Their heads will also start to show the broader, more powerful Malamute shape. These visual cues are strong indicators of their breed.

### Reaching Full Maturity

Siberian Huskies typically reach their full physical size by 12 to 18 months of age. Their growth plates close around this time. While they may fill out slightly more, their height and length are mostly set. They tend to mature mentally a bit slower. They can retain a playful, mischievous "teenage" phase for some time. This is common for many energetic breeds.

Alaskan Malamutes mature at a slower rate. They often continue to grow and fill out until they are 2 years old or even older. Their muscular development and bone density continue to increase during this period. They may not reach their full imposing size until they are well into their second year. This slower maturation means that a 1-year-old Malamute still looks like a large "teenager." A 1-year-old Husky often appears fully grown. This difference in maturation time is a significant factor in their long-term care and development. This difference also applies to variations within the Malamute breed, for example, [is there a difference between a giant Alaskan Malamute and an Alaskan Malamute](https://cosyhomecreation.com/is-there-a-difference-between-a-giant-alaskan-malamute-and-an-alaskan-malamute). Understanding these growth patterns helps you prepare for the specific needs of your puppy.

## Care and Needs: Grooming, Exercise, and Diet

Caring for Husky and Malamute puppies involves specific considerations unique to each breed. Their grooming, exercise, and dietary needs stem from their distinct physical traits and energy levels. Understanding these differences ensures a healthy and happy life for your puppy.

### Grooming Requirements

Both Huskies and Malamutes have dense double coats. This means they are heavy shedders. They shed their undercoat heavily twice a year, known as "blowing their coat." During these periods, daily brushing is essential. For the rest of the year, regular brushing, about 2-3 times a week, is usually sufficient. A good quality slicker brush and undercoat rake are necessary tools.

Alaskan Malamutes have a thicker, coarser coat. This makes them slightly more prone to matting if not brushed regularly. Their woollier undercoat holds onto loose fur more stubbornly. Their tails, with their thick plume, also require special attention. They might benefit from more frequent grooming sessions compared to Huskies.

Siberian Huskies have a smoother outer coat. While they shed profusely, their fur is generally easier to brush through. Their coat is not designed to repel water. This means they can get quite wet and take a long time to dry after a bath. Both breeds do not require frequent bathing. Excessive bathing strips their natural oils. This can damage their protective coat. Proper grooming helps manage their shedding and keeps their skin healthy.

### Exercise Needs and Training Approach

Husky puppies possess very high energy. They require extensive daily exercise. This includes long walks, runs, or vigorous play sessions. Huskies need at least 1-2 hours of intense activity every day. They excel in dog sports like agility, canicross, and skijoring. Lack of exercise can lead to destructive behaviors, like chewing or excessive howling. They are escape artists and need a securely fenced yard.

Malamute puppies also need substantial exercise. However, their exercise needs focus more on endurance than speed. Long, steady walks, hikes, or pulling activities suit them well. They are powerful dogs. They need at least 1 hour of moderate to vigorous exercise daily. They are not as prone to high-speed bursts as Huskies. Their exercise must be consistent to prevent boredom and behavioral issues. They also benefit from mental stimulation.

Both breeds are intelligent but can be stubborn. Early socialization and consistent positive reinforcement training are crucial. They benefit from obedience classes starting young. Training should be engaging and varied. They respond well to short, fun sessions rather than long, repetitive ones. It is important to establish yourself as the leader.

### Dietary Considerations

Both breeds are active and require a high-quality diet. Look for dog food formulated for large, active breeds. The food should have a good balance of protein, fat, and carbohydrates. Protein supports muscle growth. Fat provides energy. Carbohydrates fuel their activity.

Malamute puppies grow larger and have a more powerful build. Their caloric needs might be slightly higher than a Husky's as they mature. It is important to monitor their weight. Malamutes can be prone to hip and elbow dysplasia. Maintaining a healthy weight helps prevent joint issues. Overfeeding can lead to rapid growth. This puts stress on developing bones and joints.

Husky puppies also need good nutrition to support their high energy. They can be prone to sensitive stomachs. Some may have allergies. Monitoring their food intake and ensuring a balanced diet is important. Fresh water should always be available for both breeds. Consulting with a veterinarian about the best diet plan is always a good idea.
