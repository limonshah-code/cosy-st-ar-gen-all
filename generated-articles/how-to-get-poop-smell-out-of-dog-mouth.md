Getting poop smell out of your dog's mouth is a common concern for many pet owners. This unpleasant odor usually comes from a behavior called coprophagia, which means eating poop. It can be startling and definitely not pleasant.

This article will guide you through immediate fixes to address that foul odor quickly. We will explore the various reasons why dogs eat poop, from simple curiosity to underlying health issues. You will learn practical strategies to stop the behavior and maintain your dog's oral hygiene for long-term fresh breath. Get ready to turn that stinky kiss into a sweet one.

### Takeaway

*   Act quickly with immediate mouth cleaning methods for fresh breath.
*   Understand why your dog eats poop by looking at behavior, diet, and health.
*   Implement long-term solutions like training, diet changes, and good dental care.
*   Consult a vet if the problem persists or new symptoms appear.

To remove poop smell from your dog's mouth, first use immediate rinses or dental wipes. Then, address the root cause of coprophagia through dietary changes, behavioral training, and veterinary consultation to rule out medical issues. Consistent oral hygiene is key for long-term fresh breath.

## Immediate Fixes for Foul Dog Breath

You just found out your dog ate poop, and now their breath is terrible. Your first thought is to make that smell disappear right away. There are several quick actions you can take to lessen the odor and clean your dog’s mouth immediately. These methods are temporary fixes. They help with the current bad smell but do not stop the dog from eating poop again.

Start with simple mouth cleaning. You can use dog-specific dental wipes or a soft cloth wrapped around your finger. Gently wipe the inside of your dog’s cheeks, gums, and teeth. This helps remove any remaining particles that cause the smell. You can also try a dog-friendly oral rinse. These rinses often contain enzymes that break down odor-causing bacteria. Look for products designed to be swallowed safely.

Another option is brushing their teeth. Use a dog toothbrush and enzymatic toothpaste made for dogs. Never use human toothpaste. Human toothpaste contains ingredients like xylitol, which is toxic to dogs. A quick brush can significantly reduce the smell. If your dog resists brushing, try putting a small amount of toothpaste on your finger and letting them lick it off. This introduces the taste and can help them get used to it.

Some natural remedies can help mask or reduce the smell temporarily. A small amount of fresh parsley added to their food can act as a natural breath freshener. You can also offer a slice of apple or carrot. These crunchy foods can help scrape plaque and food particles from the teeth. Make sure to cut them into safe, chewable sizes to prevent choking. These quick steps help you manage the immediate problem.

## Understanding Coprophagia: Why Dogs Eat Poop

Coprophagia, the scientific term for eating feces, is a common and often distressing behavior for dog owners. It is important to understand that this behavior is natural for dogs in some contexts. For example, mother dogs often eat their puppies' waste to keep the den clean. Puppies also explore their world by mouth. They might eat poop out of curiosity.

However, adult dogs eating poop can signal different things. Sometimes, it is a learned behavior. If a dog gets attention, even negative attention, for eating poop, they might repeat it. Boredom or anxiety can also lead to coprophagia. A dog left alone for long periods might resort to eating poop simply because there is nothing else to do. This is a common way dogs cope with under-stimulation.

Nutritional deficiencies are sometimes blamed for coprophagia, but this is less common with high-quality dog foods. However, some dogs might eat poop if they are not absorbing nutrients properly. This can happen due to certain health conditions. Stress or fear can also make a dog eat poop. For example, if a dog is punished for having accidents indoors, they might eat their own waste to hide the evidence.

Environmental factors play a role too. If the dog's living area is not clean, they might eat poop to tidy up. This behavior is more likely if the dog is in a small space.

Understanding the specific reason behind your dog's coprophagia is the first step toward stopping it.

## Addressing Underlying Medical Causes of Poop Eating

While coprophagia often stems from behavioral issues, sometimes a medical problem causes it. It is important to rule out health conditions before trying behavioral solutions. A visit to your veterinarian is the best first step. They can perform a physical exam and recommend tests.

One common medical reason is malabsorption syndrome. This means your dog's body does not properly absorb nutrients from food. Dogs with malabsorption might eat poop to try to get more nutrients. Tests like blood work and fecal analysis can help diagnose this condition. Pancreatic enzyme insufficiency (PEI) is another possibility. This condition means the pancreas does not produce enough enzymes to digest food. Dogs with PEI often have stools containing undigested food. They might eat their own poop to re-digest nutrients.

Parasites can also cause a dog to eat poop. Intestinal worms or giardia can steal nutrients from your dog, leading to hunger or nutrient deficiencies. A fecal test easily identifies these parasites. Your vet can then prescribe appropriate deworming medication. Anemia or other metabolic diseases might also alter a dog's appetite or lead to unusual eating habits.

Certain medications can increase a dog's appetite or change their digestion, leading to coprophagia. For instance, steroids can make dogs very hungry. Always discuss any medications your dog is taking with your vet. They can assess if the medication contributes to the problem. Addressing these medical issues often stops the coprophagia, and thus the poop smell, quickly.

## Dietary and Nutritional Strategies to Stop Coprophagia

Diet plays a significant role in your dog's overall health and can influence behaviors like coprophagia. Ensuring your dog receives a balanced, high-quality diet is fundamental. Cheap dog foods often contain fillers and low-quality ingredients. These do not provide complete nutrition. A dog might eat poop if they are not getting enough nutrients from their regular meals.

Consider switching to a premium dog food. Look for foods with real meat as the first ingredient. Also, choose foods that have a good balance of protein, fats, and carbohydrates. Adding digestive enzymes or probiotics to your dog's food can also help. Digestive enzymes aid in breaking down food. Probiotics promote a healthy gut flora. A healthy gut means better nutrient absorption. This might reduce the urge to eat poop.

Some supplements are specifically designed to deter coprophagia. These supplements usually contain ingredients like MSG, yucca, or hot pepper extract. They are added to the dog's food and make the dog's feces taste undesirable. The idea is that once the dog eats its own poop with the supplement, it will find the taste unpleasant and stop the behavior. Always follow dosage instructions carefully.

You might also consider feeding smaller, more frequent meals. This helps manage hunger and can improve digestion. It can also prevent a dog from feeling overly hungry between meals, reducing the desire to seek out alternative food sources like feces. For general information on dog digestion, you might find [what can I give my dog to make him poop](https://cosyhomecreation.com/what-can-i-give-my-dog-to-make-him-poop) a helpful read. Proper nutrition is a powerful tool against coprophagia and its accompanying bad breath.

## Behavioral Training and Environmental Management

Once medical and dietary causes are ruled out, focusing on behavioral training and managing your dog's environment becomes key. Many cases of coprophagia are learned behaviors or responses to stress and boredom. Your approach needs consistency and patience. The goal is to make eating poop an undesirable or impossible activity.

Supervise your dog closely, especially during walks or yard time. Pick up poop immediately. Do not give your dog the chance to eat it. This is the simplest and most effective deterrent. Keep your yard clean. If you have multiple dogs, ensure one dog isn't eating another's feces. For tips on managing yard cleanliness, see [how do I make my backyard not smell like dog poop](https://cosyhomecreation.com/how-do-i-make-my-backyard-not-smell-like-dog-poop).

Teach your dog the "leave it" command. This command is invaluable for preventing them from picking up anything undesirable, including poop. Practice this command with treats. Show your dog a treat, say "leave it," and reward them when they ignore it. Then, practice with less desirable items, eventually moving to poop. When they ignore poop, give them a high-value treat. Positive reinforcement works best.

Address boredom and anxiety. A bored dog might eat poop for entertainment. Increase your dog's physical exercise and mental stimulation. Provide plenty of toys, puzzle feeders, and regular playtime. Daily walks and training sessions help a lot. If anxiety is a factor, consider professional behavioral consultation. They can help identify triggers and develop a plan.

Behavioral interventions take time, but they can be very successful.

## Long-Term Dental Hygiene for Fresh Dog Breath

Even without eating poop, many dogs develop bad breath due to poor oral hygiene. Establishing a consistent dental care routine is vital for long-term fresh breath and preventing future poop smell issues. A healthy mouth is a major step toward a happy, odor-free dog. Regular cleaning removes plaque and tartar buildup.

Brushing your dog's teeth daily is the gold standard. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush and enzymatic dog toothpaste. Start slowly if your dog is not used to it. Make it a positive experience with praise and treats. Focus on the outside surfaces of the teeth, as these are where most plaque accumulates. You can find toothbrushes designed for a dog's mouth, or even finger brushes. Consistency is more important than perfection.

Dental chews and toys can also help reduce plaque. Choose products recommended by your vet. Look for those with the Veterinary Oral Health Council (VOHC) seal. These products have been proven to reduce plaque or tartar. Chewing on safe, durable toys can also help scrape teeth clean naturally. Always supervise your dog when they are chewing to prevent choking hazards.

Professional dental cleanings at your vet's office are crucial. Even with home brushing, plaque can harden into tartar. This tartar cannot be removed by brushing alone. Your vet can perform a thorough cleaning under anesthesia. This allows them to clean below the gumline and address any dental disease. Think of it like your own regular dental check-ups. Regular professional cleanings prevent serious dental problems and keep breath fresh. While often compared to humans, remember that [does a dog have a cleaner mouth than a human](https://cosyhomecreation.com/does-a-dog-have-a-cleaner-mouth-than-a-human) is a common misconception; dogs need dental care too.

## When to Seek Veterinary Help for Coprophagia and Bad Breath

While many cases of coprophagia are behavioral, there are times when a veterinary visit is essential. If you have tried immediate fixes and basic behavioral adjustments without success, it is time to consult your vet. They can help determine if an underlying health issue causes the problem. Do not hesitate to seek professional advice.

Pay attention to any other symptoms accompanying the coprophagia. If your dog is losing weight, despite eating well, or if they show signs of lethargy, vomiting, or diarrhea, a vet visit is urgent. These symptoms could point to serious medical conditions. Pancreatic problems, intestinal parasites, or malabsorption syndromes all require a vet's diagnosis and treatment.

A sudden onset of coprophagia in an adult dog that has never shown the behavior before is also a red flag. This change in behavior could indicate a new medical issue. Similarly, if your dog's breath remains consistently foul despite regular dental care and diet changes, it is worth a check-up. Persistent bad breath can be a sign of dental disease, kidney issues, or other internal problems.

Your vet can perform a comprehensive examination. This may include blood tests, fecal tests, and a physical assessment of your dog's mouth and overall health. They can also offer tailored advice on diet, supplements, and behavioral modification. They might recommend specific deterrents or suggest working with a certified dog behaviorist. Early detection of health problems can lead to more effective treatment and a healthier dog.
