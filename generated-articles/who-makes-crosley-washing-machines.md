### Takeaway

*   Whirlpool Corporation primarily makes Crosley washing machines.
*   Crosley appliances are often private-label versions of other popular models.
*   They provide reliable laundry solutions for various households.

### Who Currently Manufactures Crosley Washing Machines?

Crosley washing machines are manufactured primarily by **Whirlpool Corporation**. Crosley operates as a private-label brand. This means another company designs and produces the products. They then sell these products under the Crosley name. Most Crosley laundry appliances, including their washers, are rebadged Whirlpool models. This provides consumers with familiar quality and features at competitive price points.

## The Enduring Legacy of the Crosley Brand

The Crosley name has a long and interesting history in American manufacturing. Powel Crosley Jr. founded the original Crosley Corporation in 1920. He was an innovator and an entrepreneur. The company first became famous for making affordable radios. This made radio ownership accessible to many families.

Crosley later expanded its product line. They started making refrigerators, automobiles, and other home appliances. The brand gained a reputation for providing reliable and inexpensive goods. This focus on affordability and accessibility set Crosley apart in its early days. The companyâ€™s innovative spirit led to many breakthroughs. They were pioneers in consumer electronics and home goods.

The original Crosley Corporation ceased appliance production in the mid-20th century. However, the brand name held significant recognition. This strong brand recognition made it valuable for future use. The name was eventually licensed for new appliance lines. This decision brought the Crosley brand back into homes nationwide.

## Crosley's Transformation in the Appliance Market

The Crosley brand today is very different from its origins. It no longer operates as an independent manufacturer. Instead, it functions as a private-label brand. This means a distributor owns the Crosley brand name. They then license its use to various manufacturers. These manufacturers produce appliances under the Crosley label.

This business model is common in the appliance industry. It allows manufacturers to reach different market segments. It also provides consumers with a wider range of options. For Crosley washing machines, this model has been quite successful. Consumers trust the Crosley name. They also benefit from the manufacturing quality of large appliance companies. This structure ensures that Crosley appliances meet modern standards. They often share technology with other well-known brands.

The transformation reflects changes in consumer buying habits. People seek reliable appliances without always paying premium prices. Crosley fills this niche by offering dependable products. These products are often similar to more expensive models from other brands. The brand's history of affordability continues to resonate.
