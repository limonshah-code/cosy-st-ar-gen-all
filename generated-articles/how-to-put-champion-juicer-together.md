## How To Put Champion Juicer Together: A Step-by-Step Assembly Guide

Bringing a new kitchen appliance home is always exciting. If you just got a Champion Juicer, you are ready to make fresh, healthy juices. But first, you need to put it together. Knowing **how to put Champion juicer together** makes the process simple and fast. This guide helps you assemble your juicer correctly. We will cover identifying parts, step-by-step assembly instructions, and tips for first use. You will learn how to get your Champion Juicer ready for action. Let's make juice!

### Takeaway

*   Identify all Champion Juicer components before starting assembly.
*   Clean all parts before the first use.
*   Follow the specific order for assembling the motor, body, screen, cutter, and front parts.
*   Ensure all parts fit securely and lock into place.
*   Perform a quick test run to check proper function.

To put a Champion Juicer together, you first identify all parts. Then, you attach the body to the motor base. Next, insert the screen and cutter securely. Finally, you lock the front assembly and feeding chute into position. This ensures the juicer is ready for safe and efficient operation.

## Understanding Your Champion Juicer Components

Before you learn how to put Champion juicer together, you need to know its parts. Each part has a specific job. Understanding each component helps with correct assembly. It also helps with proper cleaning and maintenance later on.

Your Champion Juicer comes with several key pieces. The main part is the motor housing. This is the base of the juicer. It contains the powerful motor that spins the juicing mechanism. The motor housing is heavy and stable.

Next, you have the juicing body. This part attaches to the motor housing. It holds the screen and the cutter. The juicing body guides the produce through the machine. It is a vital part of the assembly.

The cutting auger, also called the cutter, is a unique Champion part. It chews and grinds produce. This helps extract maximum juice. The cutting auger fits inside the juicing body. It works with the screen to separate pulp from juice.

The screen is another important component. It filters the juice from the pulp. Champion Juicers often come with different screens for different tasks. You might have one for juicing and another for homogenizing. Make sure you use the correct screen for your needs.

Finally, there is the front nose cone and the locking clamp. The nose cone holds the screen and cutter in place. It also directs the juice and pulp out. The locking clamp secures the entire front assembly to the juicing body. Knowing these parts makes assembly easy.

## Preparing for Assembly: Safety First & Pre-Cleaning

Before you begin to put Champion juicer together, preparation is key. Safety always comes first. Make sure your work area is clean and dry. Keep children and pets away from the assembly space. This prevents accidents and makes the process smooth.

Unpack all parts from the box. Lay them out on a flat surface. Check your owner's manual to ensure all parts are present. Sometimes, a small piece can be missed. Having everything laid out helps you see what you are working with.

It is very important to clean all juicer parts before first use. Even new appliances can have manufacturing residues. Use warm, soapy water to wash each detachable part. You do not need to wash the motor housing itself. A damp cloth can wipe down the exterior of the motor housing if needed.

Rinse all washed parts thoroughly. Soap residue can affect the taste of your juice. Let the parts air dry completely. You can also use a clean cloth to dry them. Dry parts fit together better and prevent mold growth. This step is crucial for hygiene and the long life of your juicer. This process is similar to how you would prepare other juicers for their first use, such as when you [wash a Hurom juicer](https://cosyhomecreation.com/how-to-wash-hurom-juicer). Proper cleaning ensures no unwanted flavors mix with your fresh juice.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Champion Juicer Assembly

Now, let's learn how to put Champion juicer together. This process is straightforward. Follow these steps carefully for correct assembly. My goal is to make this easy for you.

### Attaching the Motor Housing and Juicing Body

First, place the motor housing on a stable countertop. Make sure it is plugged out from any power outlet. Safety is important before you start. The motor housing is the heaviest part.

Locate the juicing body. This is the part with the large opening where the produce enters. On the bottom of the juicing body, you will see a drive shaft opening. Align this opening with the drive shaft on the motor housing. The juicing body has grooves. These grooves fit into corresponding slots on the motor housing.

Slide the juicing body onto the motor housing. You might need to rotate it slightly. It will click or lock into place when aligned correctly. Some models have a small button or lever to secure it. Ensure the juicing body is firmly seated. It should not wobble. This forms the main structure of your juicer.

### Inserting the Screen and Cutting Auger

Next, take the screen. This is a round, mesh-like part. It separates the juice from the pulp. Place the screen inside the juicing body. Ensure it sits flush against the inner walls. It should not be loose.

Now, take the cutting auger. This is the spiral-shaped part. It has a sharp end for grinding. Slide the cutting auger into the center of the screen. The pointed end of the auger should face outwards. The flat end connects with the motor's drive shaft.

You will feel the cutting auger engage with the motor's shaft. Give it a gentle twist to make sure it is fully seated. The auger should spin freely inside the screen when you turn it by hand. This confirms it is in the correct position. Proper placement of these parts is essential for efficient juicing.

### Securing the Front Assembly and Locking Clamp

The front assembly includes the nose cone. This piece directs the juice and pulp. It also keeps the screen and cutter in place. Slide the nose cone onto the front of the juicing body. It fits over the cutting auger.

There are specific grooves on the nose cone and the juicing body. Align these grooves. Push the nose cone firmly until it clicks or seats securely. You might need to rotate it a bit.

Finally, attach the locking clamp. This clamp holds the entire front assembly together. Slide the locking clamp over the nose cone and the juicing body. Push the clamp firmly towards the motor housing. Some Champion models have a latch or a screw-type clamp. Engage the latch or tighten the screw until the front assembly is secure. It should not move or wiggle. This step finishes the main assembly. Your Champion Juicer is now almost ready to make juice.

### Attaching the Plunger and Juice/Pulp Containers

After you put Champion juicer together, you have a few more small parts. These parts are important for operation. You need the food plunger. This tool helps you push produce into the juicer's feed chute. Never use your fingers or other utensils. The plunger is designed for safe use.

Place the food plunger near the juicer. It usually sits in the feed chute opening. Do not force the plunger in before you start juicing. It is just there for easy access.

Next, set up your juice and pulp containers. Champion Juicers typically come with two containers. One catches the fresh juice. The other collects the dry pulp. Position the juice container under the juice spout. Place the pulp container under the pulp ejection port. Make sure they are correctly aligned to catch everything.

These containers make juicing clean and convenient. They also help keep your countertop tidy. With all parts in place, your Champion Juicer is fully assembled. You are now ready to make your first batch of delicious, healthy juice. Remember to always have these containers in place before you turn on the juicer.

## Troubleshooting Common Assembly Issues

Sometimes, putting your Champion Juicer together might not go smoothly. Do not worry; this is normal. Many users face small issues during assembly. Knowing how to troubleshoot helps you quickly resolve problems. My aim is to help you get your juicer working fast.

One common issue is parts not fitting. If the juicing body does not attach to the motor housing, check alignment. The drive shaft must match the opening perfectly. You might need to twist the juicing body slightly. Apply gentle pressure. Forcing parts can cause damage. Make sure no small debris blocks the connection points.

Another problem can be the cutting auger or screen not seating properly. If they feel loose, recheck their position. The screen must fit snugly inside the juicing body. The cutting auger needs to fully engage with the motor's shaft. Sometimes, a slight rotation of the auger helps it drop into place. Ensure no food particles from a previous use are stuck. This is similar to ensuring all parts are clean when you [clean a Breville juicer](https://cosyhomecreation.com/how-to-clean-breville-juicer-bje510xl-2) before reassembly.

If the front nose cone or locking clamp will not secure, check alignment again. The grooves on the nose cone must match the juicing body precisely. The locking clamp requires firm pressure to engage. For models with a screw clamp, make sure it is not cross-threaded. A gentle jiggle might help everything settle into place. If a part still does not fit, consult your manual. It might offer specific diagrams. Do not operate the
