It also leads to long-term respiratory issues. Children, the elderly, and those with existing conditions are most at risk.

An air purifier removes these airborne pollutants. It draws in air from the room. Then, it passes the air through several filters. These filters trap unwanted substances. Clean air then returns to the room. This process happens continuously. Different purifiers use different filter types.

**Key Filter Types for Smoke Removal:**

*   **HEPA Filters:** High-Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters capture particles. These include dust, pollen, pet dander, and mold spores. For smoke, HEPA filters are essential. They trap the tiny solid particles in smoke. True HEPA filters capture 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns. Smoke particles can be much smaller. Dyson goes beyond this standard.
*   **Activated Carbon Filters:** Smoke also contains gases and odors. These are often volatile organic compounds (VOCs). HEPA filters do not capture gases. Activated carbon filters absorb these gases and odors. They have a porous structure. This structure traps gaseous molecules. Both HEPA and activated carbon filters are vital for smoke removal. A purifier needs both to be effective against smoke.

Some smoke types pose unique challenges. For example, wildfire smoke contains a complex mix of fine particles and gases. Cigarette smoke leaves a stubborn odor. Cooking smoke often has grease particles. A good air purifier must handle all these challenges. It needs robust filtration. It also needs strong air circulation. Choosing the right air purifier is important for your health. Many people seek a dedicated solution to remove smoke from their homes.
