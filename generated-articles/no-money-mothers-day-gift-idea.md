Time is a precious commodity. We often feel rushed and busy. Giving Mom your undivided attention is a powerful gift. This costs nothing at all. You can dedicate a whole day to her. She will feel truly seen and valued. I find that these moments create the strongest bonds.

Think about what Mom enjoys doing. Does she like to talk? Sit and listen to her stories. Does she enjoy quiet moments? Spend time reading near her. You can offer to watch a movie together. Make sure it is her favorite. Your presence shows you care deeply. It shows she is a priority.
