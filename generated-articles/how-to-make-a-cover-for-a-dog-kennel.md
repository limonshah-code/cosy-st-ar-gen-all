## DIY Dog Kennel Cover: Boost Comfort and Protection

Every dog deserves a safe and comfortable space. A dog kennel provides security, but sometimes it needs an upgrade. Adding a cover can transform a simple kennel into a private, protected den for your furry friend. This project helps your dog feel secure, sheltered from elements, and offers a quiet retreat.

Making a cover for your dog kennel is a rewarding DIY project. It lets you choose the best materials for your specific needs and your dog's comfort. I will guide you through selecting materials, taking accurate measurements, gathering tools, and building the cover step-by-step. You will learn how to make a cover that lasts. We also cover how to secure and maintain it. Get ready to give your dog the best kennel experience.

### Takeaway:
*   Making a dog kennel cover provides shelter and comfort for your pet.
*   Choose materials based on weather, durability, and your dog's needs.

Making a cover for a dog kennel involves selecting appropriate materials like canvas or tarp, accurately measuring the kennel's dimensions, cutting the material to size, and then adding grommets or ties for secure attachment. This DIY project helps protect your dog from weather and gives them a sense of security and privacy.

## Why Your Dog Needs a Kennel Cover

Your dog's kennel is more than just a place to sleep. It is their personal den, a safe space where they can relax and feel secure. Adding a cover significantly enhances this space. A well-made cover protects your dog from harsh weather conditions. This includes intense sun, heavy rain, or cold winds. It keeps your dog comfortable regardless of the outside environment.

Covers also provide a sense of privacy. Dogs often seek enclosed spaces when they feel anxious or want to rest. A covered kennel mimics a natural den, reducing stress and promoting calm behavior. This privacy helps them sleep better and feel less exposed to household activities or outdoor disturbances. It creates a quiet retreat, which is especially good for dogs who get overstimulated easily. Many people ask, [what should I put in my dog's kennel at night](https://cosyhomecreation.com/what-should-i-put-in-my-dogs-kennel-at-night)? A cover is a great first step for a peaceful night.

A cover helps regulate temperature inside the kennel. In summer, it blocks direct sunlight, keeping the kennel cooler. In winter, it can help retain warmth, making the space cozier. This temperature control is vital for your dog's health and comfort. A cover can also reduce external noise, making the kennel a more peaceful spot. This simple addition greatly improves your dog's quality of life.

## Choosing the Best Material for Your Dog Kennel Cover

Selecting the right material is a crucial step in making a durable and effective dog kennel cover. Different materials offer different benefits, so consider your climate and your dog's needs. Canvas is a popular choice. It is strong, breathable, and often water-resistant. Heavy-duty canvas provides good insulation, keeping the kennel warmer in cold weather and cooler in heat. It also blocks light well, creating a dark, den-like atmosphere.

Another excellent option is a waterproof tarp. Tarps are extremely durable and completely impervious to rain and snow. They are usually less breathable than canvas, so proper ventilation is important. You might use a tarp for the roof and sides that face the most weather. For the front or back, a more breathable material might be better. You can also get different types of materials. For instance, [what is the difference between a kennel and a crate](https://cosyhomecreation.com/what-is-the-difference-between-a-kennel-and-a-crate)? Knowing this can help you pick the correct size and type of cover material.

Shade cloth is ideal for warmer climates where sun protection is the main concern. It allows air to circulate freely while blocking a significant percentage of UV rays. This keeps the kennel cool and shaded. For temporary or lighter use, even old blankets or heavy-duty fabric can work. However, for long-lasting protection, choose materials that are resistant to tearing, fading, and mold. Look for UV-treated fabrics if the kennel stays outdoors.

## Measuring Your Kennel for a Perfect Fit

Accurate measurements are vital for a well-fitting dog kennel cover. A cover that is too small will not provide adequate protection, and one that is too large can flap in the wind or sag. Start by measuring the length of your kennel. This is usually the longest side. Then, measure the width. This is the shorter side. Finally, measure the height of the kennel from the bottom frame to the top. Note these three measurements.

You will need to decide which sides of the kennel you want to cover. Most people cover the top and at least three sides: the back and two sides. You might leave the front open or add a roll-up flap for easy access. For the top piece, cut a rectangle that matches your kennel's length and width. For the side pieces, you will need two rectangles that match the length and height, and two rectangles that match the width and height.

Add extra material for seams and hems. I recommend adding 1-2 inches to each side of your measurements for sewing. For example, if your kennel is 48 inches long, 30 inches wide, and 32 inches high, your top piece should be roughly 50x32 inches. Your long side pieces would be 50x34 inches, and your short side pieces 32x34 inches. Remember, it is better to cut slightly larger than too small. You can always trim excess material later.

## Tools and Supplies You Need to Make a Kennel Cover

Before you start cutting and sewing, gather all your necessary tools and supplies. Having everything ready saves time and makes the process smoother. The most important item is your chosen fabric. Based on your climate and needs, this could be heavy-duty canvas, waterproof tarp, or shade cloth. Make sure you have enough material to cover all the desired sides of your kennel, plus extra for hems and seams.

You will need some basic measuring and cutting tools. A sturdy tape measure is essential for accurate dimensions. A large pair of fabric scissors or a utility knife works best for cutting the material cleanly. For marking cuts, a fabric marker or chalk is useful. If you are using a sewing machine, ensure it has a heavy-duty needle suitable for thick fabrics. Otherwise, strong thread and a large hand-sewing needle will work.

To secure the cover to the kennel, you will need grommets and a grommet tool kit, or strong ties. Grommets create reinforced holes that you can thread bungees, cord, or zip ties through. If using ties, choose durable rope, elastic cord, or heavy-duty zip ties. Consider adding Velcro strips or snaps for optional flaps. Think about what you want to put in your kennel for comfort, too.

Having all these items ready before you begin ensures a smooth project.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Making Your Dog Kennel Cover

Now it is time to turn your material into a functional kennel cover. Follow these steps for a successful DIY project.

1.  **Cut Your Fabric Pieces:** Lay your chosen fabric flat. Use your measured dimensions for the top, sides, and back. Add 1-2 inches to each edge for seam allowances. Carefully cut out each piece. If you want a front flap, cut that piece separately with similar seam allowances. Label each piece if it helps.

2.  **Hem the Edges:** Fold over each edge of every fabric piece by half an inch, then again by another half inch. This creates a clean, durable hem. Stitch these hems using your sewing machine or by hand. This prevents fraying and gives your cover a finished look. If using tarp, you might skip traditional sewing and use heavy-duty adhesive or heat-sealing if suitable for the material.

3.  **Assemble the Cover Sections:** Start by attaching the side pieces to the top piece. Lay the top piece flat. Align the top edge of a side panel with the edge of the top piece, right sides together if your fabric has a distinct "right" side. Stitch them together. Repeat for all four sides if you are making a full box cover. If you are only covering the back and two sides, attach those three pieces to the top.

4.  **Add Fastening Points:** Once the main cover shape is assembled, it is time to add the attachment points. Measure and mark spots along the bottom edges and corners of the cover. These are where you will install grommets. Space them every 12-18 inches for secure attachment. Use your grommet tool kit to install each grommet according to its instructions. If using ties, sew strong fabric loops or eyelets at these same points.

5.  **Create a Front Flap (Optional):** If you designed a front flap, hem all its edges. Then, attach one edge of the flap to the front top edge of the cover using stitches or strong adhesive. Add snaps or Velcro to the bottom corners of the flap and corresponding points on the kennel cover for securing it when rolled down. You can also add ties to roll it up.

## Securing and Maintaining Your New Kennel Cover

Once your dog kennel cover is made, proper securing is essential. This prevents the cover from blowing away in windy conditions and ensures it stays put for continuous protection. Use bungee cords, zip ties, or strong rope. Thread these through the grommets you installed on your cover. Attach them securely to the kennel bars or frame. Make sure the cover is pulled taut but not stretched, as this can damage the material over time. Check all attachment points regularly to ensure they are still firm and not worn.

Maintaining your kennel cover will extend its lifespan and keep it effective. The cleaning method depends on the material you chose. For canvas, a gentle scrub with mild soap and water usually works. You can rinse it with a hose and let it air dry completely to prevent mildew. For tarps, a simple wipe-down with a damp cloth is often enough. If the cover gets very dirty, a more thorough wash with soap and water is fine. Always ensure the cover is dry before storing it or leaving it on the kennel for long periods, especially in humid conditions.

Inspect the cover periodically for any signs of wear, tear, or damage. Small holes or rips can be patched with fabric repair kits or heavy-duty tape. Address any issues promptly to prevent them from worsening. Regular maintenance keeps your kennel cover in top condition. This ensures your dog continues to enjoy a comfortable and protected space, no matter the weather.

## Customizing Your Kennel Cover for Added Comfort

Making your own dog kennel cover offers a fantastic opportunity for customization. You can add features that truly enhance your dog's comfort and adapt to your specific needs. Consider adding a clear vinyl window to one of the sides. This allows your dog to see outside without being fully exposed to the elements. It can reduce feelings of isolation. Cut out a section, hem the edges, and then sew or glue in a piece of heavy-duty clear vinyl.

For better ventilation, especially in warm climates, create roll-up panels on the sides. Instead of fully fixed side panels, design them to roll up and be secured with ties or Velcro. This lets you open up the kennel for airflow when needed. When weather changes, you can simply unroll them for full coverage. You can also add mesh inserts to specific sections for consistent airflow while keeping bugs out.

Think about extra insulation for colder weather. You can add a removable fleece or thermal lining to the inside of the cover. This simply attaches with Velcro or snaps, allowing you to remove it for cleaning or warmer months. You can also add small pockets on the outside of the cover. These pockets are great for storing treats, toys, or even a small flashlight for night-time checks. Remember, the goal is to make your dog's kennel the most comfortable and safe place possible.

## FAQ Section

### Q1: Can I use old blankets or sheets to make a kennel cover?
While old blankets or sheets can offer temporary shade or privacy, they are generally not suitable for a durable, weather-resistant kennel cover. They absorb water, are not UV resistant, and can tear easily. For lasting protection, choose materials like canvas or tarp designed for outdoor use.

### Q2: How do I make sure the kennel cover is breathable?
To ensure breathability, especially in warm climates, use materials like shade cloth or breathable canvas. You can also incorporate mesh panels or design roll-up flaps on the sides. This allows air to circulate, preventing heat buildup and maintaining a comfortable temperature inside the kennel.

### Q3: What is the best way to attach the cover to the kennel frame?
The best way to attach the cover is using grommets along the bottom edges and corners of the cover. Thread bungee cords, zip ties, or strong rope through these grommets and secure them tightly to the kennel's wire frame. This provides a strong, secure attachment that resists wind.

### Q4: How often should I clean my dog kennel cover?
Clean your dog kennel cover as needed, or at least every few months. Frequency depends on how much it is exposed to dirt, rain, or sun. Regular cleaning prevents mold and mildew buildup and keeps the material in good condition. Always ensure it is completely dry before reattaching.

### Q5: Can a kennel cover make my dog feel trapped?
A well-designed kennel cover should make your dog feel safe and secure, not trapped. Dogs often seek den-like spaces for comfort. If your dog shows signs of distress, ensure there is enough ventilation and consider a cover with a roll-up front flap or view window so they can see out if they wish.

### Q6: How do I prevent the kennel cover from flapping in the wind?
To prevent flapping, ensure the cover fits snugly and is pulled taut when secured. Use enough attachment points, spaced closely together (every 12-18 inches). Bungee cords work well because they provide tension. Check and tighten attachments regularly, especially after strong winds.
