## Setting Up Your Dog's Kennel for a Peaceful Night

As a dog owner, ensuring my furry friend sleeps well is very important. Many people ask, "What should I put in my dog's kennel at night?" Creating a comfortable and safe space helps your dog settle down. A well-equipped kennel promotes better sleep and reduces nighttime anxiety. This article explores essential items for your dog's kennel, from bedding to comfort toys and practical considerations like water and temperature.

Understanding what goes into your dog's sleeping area makes a big difference. We will cover bedding choices, safety measures, and how to make the kennel a calming retreat. You will learn about appropriate toys, managing water, and maintaining the right temperature. We also discuss how to address common nighttime issues. Let us create the best sleep environment for your beloved dog.

### Takeaway:

*   **Comfortable Bedding:** Provide soft, supportive bedding that fits the kennel size.
*   **Safety First:** Remove choking hazards; ensure the kennel is appropriately sized and secure.
*   **Comfort Items:** Include a familiar blanket or a safe chew toy.
*   **Water Access:** Offer a spill-proof water bowl for hydration.
*   **Temperature Regulation:** Ensure the kennel location is not too hot or cold.
*   **Consistent Routine:** Establish a predictable bedtime routine.

To create the ideal sleep environment, you should put comfortable, safe bedding in your dog's kennel. Include a non-spill water bowl, a familiar comfort item like a blanket or T-shirt, and one safe chew toy. Ensure the kennel is the right size and in a quiet, temperature-controlled area, promoting a sense of security and peaceful sleep for your dog.

## The Foundation: Comfortable Bedding for a Good Night's Sleep

A comfortable bed is the most important thing to put in your dog's kennel at night. Just like us, dogs need a soft place to rest. Good bedding helps them feel secure and supported throughout the night. It also provides insulation, keeping them warm in colder months and off cold surfaces. Choosing the right bedding type depends on your dog's chewing habits, age, and any health conditions.

Consider durability when selecting bedding for your dog's kennel. Some dogs love to chew, so a tough, chew-resistant mat might be better than a plush bed. For older dogs or those with joint issues, an orthopedic bed provides extra support. This type of bed reduces pressure on their joints, making sleep more restful. Always ensure the bedding fits the kennel size properly, leaving enough room for your dog to stand up, turn around, and lie down comfortably. Choosing the right bedding can make a big difference in how well your dog sleeps.

### Types of Kennel Bedding:

*   **Soft Blankets or Towels:** These are easy to wash and provide warmth. They are great for puppies or dogs who do not chew much. I often use old, soft blankets.
*   **Crate Pads:** These are specifically designed to fit kennel dimensions. They often have non-slip bottoms and come in various thicknesses. Some are waterproof.
*   **Orthopedic Beds:** Made with memory foam or supportive filling, these are ideal for older dogs or those with arthritis. They offer superior joint support.
*   **Elevated Beds:** These raise your dog off the floor, promoting air circulation. They are excellent for keeping dogs cool in warmer climates or for dogs who prefer a firmer surface.
*   **Chew-Resistant Mats:** If your dog chews everything, look for heavy-duty, reinforced mats. These withstand chewing better than standard beds.

Regular cleaning of your dog's bedding is also crucial. A clean bed prevents odors and reduces the risk of skin irritations or allergies. Most kennel bedding is machine washable, making maintenance simple. Always follow the washing instructions to ensure the bedding lasts a long time. A fresh, clean bed contributes significantly to your dog's comfort and well-being every night.

## Safety First: Essential Items and What to Avoid

Safety in your dog's kennel at night is paramount. The items you choose must not pose any choking hazards or risks of injury. This means avoiding small objects that could be swallowed, ropes that could fray, or anything with loose parts. Always inspect toys and bedding regularly for wear and tear. If an item becomes damaged, remove it immediately to prevent accidents.

Ensure the kennel itself is the correct size for your dog. A kennel that is too small restricts movement and can cause discomfort. A kennel that is too large might encourage potty accidents inside, as your dog does not feel the need to keep their sleeping area clean. Your dog should be able to stand up, turn around, and lie down comfortably without touching the sides or top. If you have a large dog, understanding [how big should a kennel be for a large dog](https://cosyhomecreation.com/how-big-should-a-kennel-be-for-a-large-dog) is essential. Also, make sure the kennel door latches securely. This prevents accidental escapes during the night. A secure kennel provides peace of mind for you and safety for your dog.

### What to Include for Safety:

*   **Non-Toxic Materials:** All bedding, toys, and accessories should be made from pet-safe, non-toxic materials. Check product labels for safety certifications.
*   **Appropriate Size:** Ensure all items are suitable for your dog's size. Small items are choking hazards for large dogs. Large items might not fit properly for small dogs.
*   **Secure Latches:** Double-check that the kennel door has a strong, reliable latch. This prevents your dog from escaping during the night.
*   **Good Ventilation:** The kennel should allow for proper airflow. This prevents overheating and ensures your dog breathes fresh air.
*   **Supervise New Items:** Introduce new items during the day under supervision. This helps you observe how your dog interacts with them. This way, you can spot any potential problems.

### What to Avoid:

*   **Small, Swallowed Objects:** Remove toys with small parts that can break off. Avoid items that are small enough for your dog to swallow.
*   **Loose Strings or Ropes:** These can get tangled around your dog's neck or limbs. They also pose a choking risk if ingested.
*   **Fragile or Easily Broken Items:** Glass, ceramic, or thin plastic items can shatter. Sharp edges could injure your dog.
*   **Excessive Clutter:** Too many items can make the kennel feel cramped. This reduces comfort and increases accident risks.
*   **Toxic Plants or Chemicals:** Ensure no harmful substances are within reach of the kennel. This includes houseplants or cleaning products.

Prioritizing safety ensures your dog's kennel remains a secure sanctuary. A safe environment allows your dog to relax fully. This promotes a restful night's sleep for both of you.

## Entertainment & Comfort: Toys and Comfort Items

Even at night, some dogs benefit from having a comfort item or a safe chew toy in their kennel. These items can help ease anxiety and provide a sense of security. A comfort item can be a familiar blanket, an old T-shirt with your scent, or a soft plush toy. The scent of a loved one can be very calming for a dog. It reminds them of you and makes them feel less alone in their kennel. I always make sure my dog has his favorite small blanket.

Chew toys can be helpful, especially for puppies or dogs who need to work off some energy before settling down. Choose a durable, safe chew toy that your dog cannot easily destroy or swallow. Avoid toys with squeakers or loud components that might disturb your sleep. The goal is to provide quiet comfort or a gentle distraction. A favorite toy can help a dog feel more at home in their kennel. It helps them view the kennel as a positive space.

### Choosing Comfort Items:

*   **Scented Item:** An old T-shirt or blanket that smells like you can be incredibly reassuring. Your scent provides comfort and reduces feelings of loneliness.
*   **Familiar Plush Toy:** If your dog has a favorite soft toy they do not destroy, it can offer emotional support. Ensure it is not too large and does not have small parts that can be chewed off.
*   **Gradual Introduction:** Introduce comfort items during the day. Let your dog get used to them in the kennel before bedtime. This helps them associate the item with comfort.

### Selecting Safe Chew Toys:

*   **Durable Rubber Toys:** Toys made from hard, durable rubber are excellent. They withstand chewing and provide mental stimulation. Brands like Kong are popular choices.
*   **Puzzle Toys (Empty):** Some puzzle toys can be placed empty in the kennel. They offer a familiar shape and texture without food rewards to prevent late-night bathroom breaks.
*   **Nylon Chew Bones:** These are very durable and come in various sizes. They satisfy a dog's natural urge to chew. Always choose the appropriate size for your dog to prevent choking.
*   **No Rawhides or Edible Chews:** Avoid edible chews or rawhides in the kennel at night. They can be choking hazards without supervision. They also might encourage nighttime bathroom trips.
*   **Size Appropriately:** The toy should be large enough that your dog cannot swallow it. It should also be small enough to fit comfortably in the kennel.

The right comfort item or chew toy makes the kennel a more inviting space. It helps your dog feel content and relaxed. This leads to a more peaceful night for everyone.

## Hydration & Routine: Water and Potty Breaks

Providing water in your dog's kennel at night is a common concern. For most adult dogs, a spill-proof water bowl in the kennel is acceptable and often recommended. Dogs can get thirsty during the night, especially in warmer environments or if they are very active during the day. Access to water ensures they stay hydrated and comfortable. However, for puppies or dogs still learning bladder control, you might need to reconsider.

For puppies, limiting water intake an hour or two before bedtime can help prevent accidents. Offer plenty of water during the day. Then, take them out for a final potty break right before kenneling. If your dog is prone to nighttime accidents, you might temporarily remove the water bowl. Always consult with your vet if nighttime accidents are a persistent issue, as it could indicate a medical problem. Understanding [is it normal for dogs to pee in the middle of the night](https://cosyhomecreation.com/is-it-normal-for-dogs-to-pee-in-the-middle-of-the-night) can provide more context. For adult dogs with good bladder control, a non-spill bowl provides necessary hydration.

### Managing Water Access:

*   **Spill-Proof Bowls:** Use a bowl designed to attach to the kennel bars or a heavy, tip-resistant bowl. This prevents spills and keeps the bedding dry.
*   **Check Hydration Levels:** Ensure your dog has had plenty of water throughout the day. This reduces the urge to drink excessively at night.
*   **Puppy Considerations:** For young puppies, remove water 1-2 hours before bed. This helps prevent accidents.
*   **Medical Conditions:** Dogs with certain health issues, like diabetes or kidney problems, may need constant water access. Consult your vet for advice.

Establishing a consistent nighttime routine is just as important as what you put in the kennel. Dogs thrive on routine. A predictable sequence of events signals to them that it is time to settle down. This routine helps them mentally prepare for sleep. It can significantly reduce anxiety and restlessness in the kennel.

### Building a Nighttime Routine:

*   **Last Potty Break:** Always take your dog out for a final potty break right before bedtime. Even if they do not seem to need to go, offer the chance.
*   **Quiet Time:** Create a calm environment an hour or so before kenneling. Dim the lights, lower noise levels, and engage in quiet activities like gentle petting.
*   **Exercise Earlier:** Ensure your dog gets enough exercise during the day. A tired dog sleeps better. Avoid strenuous activity too close to bedtime.
*   **Consistent Time:** Put your dog in their kennel at the same time every night. Consistency helps regulate their internal clock.
*   **Positive Reinforcement:** Make kennel time a positive experience. Use treats, praise, and a calm voice. Never use the kennel as punishment.
*   **Pre-Kennel Ritual:** Develop a small ritual, like a specific phrase or treat before they enter. This signals "bedtime."

A consistent routine, combined with thoughtful water management, sets your dog up for a restful night. It helps them feel secure and understand expectations. This leads to fewer disturbances for everyone.

## Temperature Matters: Keeping Your Dog Warm or Cool

The temperature inside your dog's kennel is critical for their comfort and health. Dogs can get too hot or too cold, which affects their ability to sleep soundly. You need to consider the ambient temperature of your home and your dog's breed and coat type. A comfortable temperature ensures they are not shivering or panting excessively. This helps them stay relaxed.

In colder climates or during winter nights, extra bedding or a kennel cover can provide much-needed warmth. A thick blanket or a self-warming mat adds insulation. Make sure there are no drafts near the kennel. Conversely, in warmer environments, ensure proper ventilation. Avoid placing the kennel in direct sunlight or next to heat sources. An elevated bed can help with airflow. Your dog's comfort greatly depends on maintaining a suitable temperature range. If you are worried about the cold, [how do I know if my dog is cold at night in crate](https://cosyhomecreation.com/how-do-i-know-if-my-dog-is-cold-at-night-in-crate) offers helpful signs to watch for.

### Keeping Your Dog Warm:

*   **Insulated Bedding:** Use a thick, warm blanket or a self-warming pet mat. These provide a cozy layer.
*   **Crate Cover:** A breathable kennel cover can help retain heat inside the kennel. It also creates a den-like feel.
*   **Avoid Drafts:** Place the kennel away from windows, doors, or vents that might let in cold drafts.
*   **Dog Sweaters/Pajamas:** For short-haired breeds or those sensitive to cold, a dog sweater or pajamas can provide extra warmth. Ensure they are comfortable and not restrictive.
*   **Safe Heating Pads:** If using a heating pad, choose one designed for pets with an automatic shut-off. Place it under half the bed so your dog can move off it if they get too warm.

### Keeping Your Dog Cool:

*   **Elevated Beds:** These raise your dog off the floor, allowing air to circulate beneath them. This helps dissipate body heat.
*   **Cooling Mats:** Gel-filled cooling mats absorb body heat. They offer a cool surface for your dog to lie on. These do not require refrigeration.
*   **Proper Ventilation:** Ensure good airflow around the kennel. Do not cover the kennel completely if it is warm.
*   **Water Access:** Always provide fresh water to help your dog regulate their body temperature.
*   **Avoid Direct Sunlight:** Do not place the kennel where it will receive direct sunlight, especially in the evening or morning.
*   **Fan or AC:** If your home is generally warm, a fan or air conditioning unit can help keep the room temperature comfortable. Position fans so they circulate air, not directly on the kennel.

Monitoring your dog's behavior is the best way to tell if they are comfortable. Shivering, curling up tightly, or seeking cover indicates they are cold. Excessive panting, spreading out, or avoiding bedding suggests they are too hot. Adjust the kennel environment as needed to ensure their optimal comfort.

## Addressing Anxieties: Helping Your Dog Settle In

Some dogs experience anxiety when placed in their kennel at night. This can manifest as whining, barking, or destructive behavior. It is important to address these anxieties kindly and consistently. Your goal is to help your dog view the kennel as a safe, positive space, not a place of punishment or isolation. A comfortable kennel setup is the first step in reducing stress.

Consistency in routine and positive associations with the kennel are key. Never use the kennel for punishment. Always make going into the kennel a rewarding experience. This includes treats, praise, or even a special toy only given in the kennel. For dogs who cry or bark, ignoring the behavior initially might be necessary to avoid reinforcing it. However, excessive crying warrants attention. If you are dealing with a dog that cries in the kennel, especially a small breed, resources on [how do I get my chihuahua to stop crying at night](https://cosyhomecreation.com/how-do-i-get-my-chihuahua-to-stop-crying-at-night) might offer specific solutions.

### Strategies to Reduce Kennel Anxiety:

*   **Gradual Introduction:** Never force your dog into the kennel. Introduce it slowly. Leave the door open during the day with treats inside. Let them explore at their own pace.
*   **Positive Reinforcement:** Always use treats, praise, and toys when your dog enters the kennel willingly. Make it a fun game.
*   **Familiar Scent:** Place an item with your scent, like an old T-shirt, in the kennel. This provides comfort and reassurance.
*   **Cover the Kennel:** A breathable kennel cover can create a den-like feel. This offers a sense of security and reduces outside distractions.
*   **White Noise or Calming Music:** Gentle sounds can block out unsettling noises and promote relaxation. There are specific pet-calming music playlists.
*   **Tired Dog is a Good Dog:** Ensure your dog gets plenty of physical and mental exercise during the day. A well-exercised dog is more likely to settle down at night.
*   **Patience and Consistency:** It takes time for a dog to adjust. Be patient and stick to your routine. Avoid giving in to whining, as this teaches them that crying gets them out.
*   **Consult a Professional:** If anxiety is severe, consult a certified dog trainer or a veterinary behaviorist. They can provide tailored strategies.

### Addressing Barking or Crying:

*   **Rule Out Needs:** First, ensure your dog does not need a potty break or is not experiencing discomfort. Take them out briefly, then immediately return them to the kennel.
*   **Ignore if Attention-Seeking:** If you are certain all needs are met, ignore the barking or crying for a short period. Any attention, even negative, can reinforce the behavior.
*   **Quiet Re-entry:** If you must intervene, do so calmly. Do not talk to or fuss over your dog. Just ensure they are safe and return them to the kennel.
*   **Gradual Increase in Time:** Start with short periods in the kennel. Slowly increase the duration as your dog becomes more comfortable.
*   **Positive Associations:** Always associate the kennel with positive things. Give a special treat when they go in.

Helping your dog overcome kennel anxiety builds a stronger bond. It creates a more peaceful home environment for everyone. A calm dog means a calm night.

## Kennel Training Tips for Nighttime Success

Successful kennel training for nighttime requires patience, consistency, and a positive approach. The goal is to make the kennel a desirable place for your dog to sleep. This starts with proper introduction and builds through consistent routine. My own dog initially struggled, but a consistent approach made all the difference.

Never use the kennel as punishment. This creates negative associations. Instead, ensure every interaction with the kennel is positive. This helps your dog view it as their personal den, a safe and secure space. A well-kennel-trained dog sleeps better and feels more secure. This also gives you peace of mind.

### Key Kennel Training Strategies:

*   **Positive Introduction:**
    *   Leave the kennel door open. Place treats, toys, or a favorite blanket inside.
    *   Let your dog explore the kennel on their own terms. Never force them in.
    *   Feed meals near or inside the kennel. This builds positive associations with food.
*   **Short, Supervised Periods:**
    *   Start with very short kennel times during the day. Increase the duration gradually.
    *   Stay nearby initially. Then, gradually leave the room for brief periods.
    *   Always return before your dog gets anxious or starts to fuss.
*   **Consistent Routine:**
    *   Establish a predictable bedtime routine. This signals to your dog that it's time to settle down.
    *   Include a final potty break, quiet playtime, and a specific "bedtime" command.
    *   Consistency helps regulate their internal clock and reduces anxiety. For more on nighttime routines, explore [how to train your dog not to go out at night](https://cosyhomecreation.com/how-to-train-your-dog-not-to-go-out-at-night).
*   **Tire Them Out (Appropriately):**
    *   Ensure your dog gets adequate physical and mental exercise during the day.
    *   A tired dog is more likely to sleep soundly through the night.
    *   Avoid strenuous play right before bedtime, as this can energize them.
*   **Ignore Whining (After Needs Are Met):**
    *   If your dog whines or barks after being kenneled, first ensure they do not need to go potty.
    *   If their needs are met, ignore the whining for short periods. Any attention, even negative, can reinforce the behavior.
    *   Only praise them when they are quiet.
*   **Cover the Kennel:**
    *   A breathable cover can create a cozy, den-like atmosphere.
    *   This reduces visual distractions and helps your dog feel more secure.
*   **Safe & Comfortable Environment:**
    *   Ensure the kennel contains comfortable bedding, a safe chew toy, and a spill-proof water bowl.
    *   The kennel should be the right size. It needs to be in a quiet, temperature-controlled area.
*   **Patience and Persistence:**
    *   Kennel training takes time. Some dogs adapt quickly, others take longer.
    *   Do not get discouraged. Consistency is key to long-term success.

Remember, a well-kennel-trained dog is a happy dog. It is also a safe dog. Investing time in proper kennel training yields benefits for years to come. This creates a calm and harmonious home environment. Ultimately, it also allows you to rest easy knowing your dog is comfortable and secure. Moreover, knowing [is it okay to leave a dog in a kennel overnight](https://cosyhomecreation.com/is-it-okay-to-leave-a-dog-in-a-kennel-overnight) can reassure you about this practice.

## Creating a Holistic Sleep Environment

Beyond the immediate items inside the kennel, the surrounding environment plays a significant role in your dog's nighttime comfort. Think about where the kennel is placed within your home. A quiet, low-traffic area is usually best. This minimizes disturbances and helps your dog feel secure. My dog's kennel is in a quiet corner of my bedroom. This helps him feel close to me but still in his own space.

Consider light and sound levels. Just like humans, dogs sleep better in a dark, quiet room. Dimming lights and minimizing noise as bedtime approaches helps signal to your dog that it is time to wind down. These external factors, combined with the right items inside the kennel, create a truly holistic sleep environment for your canine companion.

### Environmental Factors for Nighttime Comfort:

*   **Location:**
    *   **Quiet Area:** Place the kennel in a quiet part of your home. Avoid high-traffic areas like hallways or busy living rooms.
    *   **Proximity to You:** For puppies or dogs with separation anxiety, placing the kennel near your bed initially can be very comforting. You can gradually move it later if desired.
    *   **Avoid Extremes:** Do not place the kennel near drafty windows, heating vents, or direct sunlight. This helps regulate temperature.
*   **Light Control:**
    *   **Darkness:** Ensure the room is dark or dim at night. Use blackout curtains if streetlights are an issue. Darkness helps regulate melatonin, the sleep hormone.
    *   **Night Lights (Optional):** Some dogs might prefer a very dim night light. This is especially true if they are anxious in complete darkness. However, most dogs prefer dark.
*   **Sound Management:**
    *   **Quiet Hours:** Establish quiet hours before bedtime. This means turning off loud TVs, reducing talking, and minimizing sudden noises.
    *   **White Noise Machine:** A white noise machine can block out household noises or outdoor sounds. This helps create a consistent, calming soundscape.
    *   **Calming Music:** Some pet owners find specific calming music tracks helpful. These are designed to relax animals.
*   **Air Quality and Freshness:**
    *   **Ventilation:** Ensure good air circulation in the room. This prevents stuffiness.
    *   **Cleanliness:** Keep the area around the kennel clean and free of dust or strong odors. Regular vacuuming helps.
*   **Consistency is Key:**
    *   **Predictable Schedule:** Maintain a consistent feeding, exercise, and potty break schedule throughout the day. This helps regulate your dog's internal clock.
    *   **Bedtime Ritual:** A short, calming bedtime ritual signals to your dog that it's time to sleep. This could be a gentle brush, a final potty break, or a quiet cuddle.

Creating a holistic sleep environment means looking beyond just the kennel. It means optimizing the entire space where your dog sleeps. This comprehensive approach promotes deeper sleep, reduces anxiety, and strengthens the bond between you and your dog. A well-rested dog is a happier, healthier dog.

## Troubleshooting Common Nighttime Kennel Issues

Even with a perfect setup, some dogs might experience issues in their kennel at night. Common problems include whining, barking, accidents, or restlessness. Addressing these requires patience and understanding. Each issue often points to an underlying cause that needs attention. My experience has taught me that consistency and observation are key to resolving these challenges.

The first step is always to rule out basic needs. Is your dog needing a potty break? Are they too hot or cold? Once these are checked, you can delve deeper into behavioral causes. Persistent issues may require professional help. Remember, your dog is communicating something through their behavior.

### Common Issues and Solutions:

*   **Whining or Barking:**
    *   **Potty Check:** First, immediately take them out for a quick potty break. If they go, it was a legitimate need.
    *   **Ignore Attention-Seeking:** If you are certain all needs are met, ignore the whining for a short period. Any attention, even negative, reinforces the behavior. Wait for a moment of quiet before praising.
    *   **Gradual Adjustment:** If new to kennel, increase time in kennel very slowly during the day.
    *   **Comfort Item:** Ensure they have a familiar, scented item or comfort toy.
    *   **Anxiety:** If it seems like separation anxiety, consider a Thundershirt, calming supplements (vet-approved), or consulting a professional trainer.
*   **Potty Accidents in the Kennel:**
    *   **Last Potty Break:** Ensure the last potty break before bed is thorough.
    *   **Water Restriction:** Limit water intake an hour or two before bedtime, especially for puppies.
    *   **Kennel Size:** Is the kennel too large? Dogs usually avoid soiling their sleeping area. A large kennel might allow them to pee in one corner and sleep in another.
    *   **Medical Check:** Rule out urinary tract infections or other medical issues with a vet visit.
    *   **Cleanliness:** Clean accidents thoroughly with an enzymatic cleaner. This eliminates odors that attract them back.
*   **Restlessness or Digging:**
    *   **Exercise:** Ensure your dog is sufficiently tired from physical and mental exercise during the day.
    *   **Comfort:** Is the bedding comfortable? Is the temperature appropriate?
    *   **Anxiety:** Provide a comfort item. Try a kennel cover for a den-like feel.
    *   **Chewing:** If digging is accompanied by chewing, ensure they have a safe, durable chew toy.
*   **Refusal to Enter Kennel:**
    *   **Positive Association:** Revert to positive introduction steps. Feed meals in the kennel. Toss treats inside.
    *   **Never Punish:** Do not use the kennel as punishment.
    *   **Make it Fun:** Play games where treats are "found" in the kennel.
    *   **Praise:** Heavily praise and reward any voluntary entry.
*   **Overheating/Cold:**
    *   **Check Temperature:** Feel your dog's ears or body. Adjust blankets or cooling mats as needed.
    *   **Ventilation:** Ensure adequate airflow. Do not fully cover the kennel if it's hot.
    *   **Location:** Move the kennel away from drafts or direct heat/sunlight.
    *   **Breeding:** Consider your dog's breed. Huskies handle cold well, Chihuahuas need more warmth.

Troubleshooting takes time. Consistency, patience, and positive reinforcement are your most powerful tools. If an issue persists despite your best efforts, do not hesitate to seek advice from your veterinarian or a certified dog trainer. They can offer tailored solutions for your dog's specific needs.

## FAQ Section

### Should I put a blanket in my dog's kennel at night?
Yes, putting a soft, comfortable blanket or crate pad in your dog's kennel is highly recommended. It provides warmth, comfort, and a sense of security. Ensure the blanket is chew-resistant
