## Understanding the White German Shepherd Breed Standard

Have you ever seen a stunning, all-white German Shepherd Dog? These beautiful canines often catch our eye. Many people wonder if their pure white coat meets an official breed standard. It is a common question among dog lovers and potential owners. Today, we will explore this topic thoroughly.

We will look at the history of white-coated German Shepherds. We will also discuss how major kennel clubs view their white color. Then, we will introduce the Berger Blanc Suisse, a distinct breed often confused with the White German Shepherd. You will learn about its specific breed standard. This article will help you understand the true status of these magnificent dogs.

### Takeaway

The key takeaway is that while "White German Shepherd" is a popular term, white is a disqualifying fault in the official German Shepherd Dog breed standard by major organizations like the AKC and FCI. However, an officially recognized breed, the Berger Blanc Suisse (White Swiss Shepherd), embodies a specific standard for white-coated herding dogs, allowing those who admire the type to find a purebred companion.

A White German Shepherd, as commonly understood, refers to a German Shepherd Dog born with a white coat, which is considered a disqualifying fault in breed standards by organizations like the American Kennel Club (AKC) and Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI). However, an officially recognized breed known as the Berger Blanc Suisse, or White Swiss Shepherd, *does* have a specific breed standard for its white coat, often seen as the true "standard" for this type of dog.

## The Origins of White in German Shepherd Dogs

The German Shepherd Dog breed started in the late 1800s. Captain Max von Stephanitz aimed to create a versatile working dog. He developed the breed from traditional German herding dogs. Some of these original herding dogs carried genes for a white coat.

So, white puppies appeared in early German Shepherd litters. These dogs were purebred German Shepherds. Their white color was simply a natural genetic variation. Early breeders did not see the white coat as a problem. They valued intelligence and working ability above coat color.

However, over time, opinions on coat color changed. Certain colors became preferred for show rings. White began to fall out of favor. This shift eventually led to rules against the white coat.

## Why White Became a Disqualification for German Shepherds

Major kennel clubs began to define strict breed standards for German Shepherds. These standards detail ideal physical traits and temperament. The American Kennel Club (AKC) and the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI) are two such organizations. They set the global benchmarks for many breeds. They decided that white was not a desired coat color.

The AKC's official German Shepherd Dog standard lists white as a disqualifying fault. This means a white German Shepherd cannot compete in conformation shows. It cannot earn championship titles under their rules. The FCI also has a similar stance. Their standard states that a white coat is an undesirable characteristic. This does not mean the dog is unhealthy or not purebred. It simply means it does not fit the ideal aesthetic for show purposes.

This decision was purely about appearance, not health or ability. White German Shepherds can be just as intelligent and capable as their colored counterparts. They just do not conform to the show ring's specific requirements. Many people still appreciate these dogs for their beauty and temperament. They continue to be loving family pets.

## Distinguishing the White German Shepherd and White Swiss Shepherd

It is important to understand a key distinction. Many people use the term "White German Shepherd" loosely. This often refers to any German Shepherd dog with a white coat. However, there is a separate, recognized breed that is entirely white. This breed is the Berger Blanc Suisse, also known as the White Swiss Shepherd.

The Berger Blanc Suisse is a distinct breed. It developed from the same lineage as the German Shepherd. However, breeders in Switzerland and other European countries chose to embrace the white coat. They developed a separate breed standard specifically for white dogs. This breed is recognized by the FCI. It has its own unique standard.

So, while a "White German Shepherd" might be a German Shepherd with a white coat, the Berger Blanc Suisse is a breed where the white coat is the standard. This means they are bred specifically for that color. They also have subtle differences in temperament and structure from the standard German Shepherd. Understanding this difference helps clarify breed standards.

## How White Swiss Shepherd Standards Compare to German Shepherd Standards

The White Swiss Shepherd (Berger Blanc Suisse) and the German Shepherd Dog share common ancestors. This shared history means they have many similarities. Both breeds are intelligent, loyal, and capable working dogs. They both have a strong desire to please their owners. Their general body structure also shows a strong resemblance.

However, their breed standards have key differences. The most obvious difference is coat color. White is the only acceptable color for the Berger Blanc Suisse. In contrast, white is a disqualifying fault for the German Shepherd Dog. German Shepherds come in various colors like black and tan, sable, or solid black. For example, understanding what distinguishes [a blue German Shepherd from a black German Shepherd](https://cosyhomecreation.com/what-is-the-difference-between-a-blue-german-shepherd-and-a-black-german-shepherd) highlights the range of acceptable GSD colors, none of which include white.

Beyond color, subtle structural differences exist. Berger Blanc Suisse dogs often have a slightly straighter back. German Shepherds, especially show lines, can have a more sloped back. The temperament standards also differ. Berger Blanc Suisse dogs are typically described as softer and less driven than some German Shepherd lines. German Shepherds often have a more pronounced protective instinct and higher drive for protection work. These distinctions are crucial when evaluating a dog against its specific breed standard. Knowing [how to tell if a dog is a German Shepherd](https://cosyhomecreation.com/how-do-you-tell-if-a-dog-is-a-german-shepherd) can also help identify their core characteristics, irrespective of coat color.

## Health Considerations for White Coated Dogs

People sometimes worry about white-coated dogs having more health problems. This concern usually comes from misunderstanding. True albinism, which involves a complete lack of pigment and often red eyes, can lead to health issues. These issues include poor eyesight and increased skin sensitivity. However, White German Shepherds and Berger Blanc Suisse dogs are not albinos. Their white coat is due to a gene that masks other colors. They still have normal pigment in their eyes, nose, and paw pads.

Therefore, the white coat itself does not cause specific health problems. These dogs face the same general health concerns as any large, active breed. Common issues include hip and elbow dysplasia. These are genetic conditions affecting joints. Bloat, a life-threatening stomach condition, is also a concern. Eye conditions can occur, but not more so than in other colors.

Responsible breeders conduct health screenings for these issues. They test parent dogs before breeding them. This helps reduce the risk of passing on genetic diseases. Choosing a reputable breeder is crucial for a healthy puppy. The white coat is simply an aesthetic trait. It does not indicate inherent health weaknesses.

## Finding a White German Shepherd or Berger Blanc Suisse

If you are looking for a white-coated dog that resembles a German Shepherd, you have a few options. The first step is to decide which type of dog you truly want. Do you want a German Shepherd with a white coat, or an official Berger Blanc Suisse? The answer will guide your search.

If you seek an official Berger Blanc Suisse, look for breeders registered with national or international kennel clubs. These breeders adhere to the breed standard. They also perform health screenings. This ensures the puppy is purebred and healthy. You can check the FCI website or national White Swiss Shepherd clubs for lists of reputable breeders.

If you are interested in a white-coated German Shepherd, be aware of the AKC/FCI standard. Such dogs are purebred German Shepherds. However, their white color disqualifies them from conformation shows. They are still wonderful companions. Look for breeders who prioritize health and temperament, even if they breed for white coats. Verify parentage and health clearances. Some people might wonder if there's a specific breed that looks like a German Shepherd but is all white; this is essentially describing the Berger Blanc Suisse.
