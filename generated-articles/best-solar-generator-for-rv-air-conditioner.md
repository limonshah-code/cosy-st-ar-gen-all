First, determine your RV air conditioner's precise power requirements. Check the AC unit's label, usually found on the side or bottom. Look for "Running Watts" and "Starting Watts" (sometimes listed as "Locked Rotor Amps" or LRA, which you can convert to watts by multiplying by voltage). For example, a common 13,500 BTU RV AC might draw around 1,500-2,000 running watts and need 3,000-4,000 starting watts. Your solar generator's continuous output wattage must exceed the AC's running watts. Its surge wattage capacity must exceed the AC's starting watts.

Next, consider the required battery capacity, measured in Watt-hours (Wh). This dictates how long your AC can run on a single charge. Calculate your desired runtime. If your AC uses 1,500 watts and you want to run it for 4 hours, you need a minimum of 1,500 watts * 4 hours = 6,000 Wh. Account for inverter efficiency losses (typically 10-15%). So, you would actually need closer to 6,600 Wh to 7,000 Wh. It's often smart to choose a generator with more capacity than your minimum calculated need. This provides a buffer. For instance, if you need a high-capacity system, generators providing 6000 watts are available. You can learn more about these powerful units here: [Best 6000 watt solar generator](https://cosyhomecreation.com/best-6000-watt-solar-generator).

Consider the solar charging input. A higher solar input wattage allows for faster recharging of your generator's battery. If you plan to run your AC during the day, you will want solar panels that can keep up with the AC's power draw. Aim for solar input that matches or exceeds your AC's running watts for continuous daytime operation. For example, a 1500-watt AC needs substantial solar input, and a 1500-watt solar generator system might be appropriate. You can find more information on these specific wattage systems here: [Best 1500 watt solar generator](https://cosyhomecreation.com/best-1500-watt-solar-generator). If your power needs are somewhat lower, a 300-watt solar generator might suffice for smaller appliances, but likely not for an RV AC.

Lastly, think about the amp requirements. Some RVs use 30-amp systems. Your solar generator should provide enough current. A generator specifically designed for 30-amp RV connections can simplify setup and ensure compatibility. You can find more details about such generators here: [Best 30 amp solar generator](https://cosyhomecreation.com/best-30-amp-solar-generator).
