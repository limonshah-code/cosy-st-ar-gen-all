Safety is important on any holiday. It is especially true with fireworks. Use fireworks with extreme caution. Always read instructions carefully. Keep a bucket of water nearby. Supervise children at all times. Never allow children to handle fireworks alone. Public displays are safest.

Do not aim for perfection. Things might not go exactly as planned. A relaxed host makes for relaxed guests. Embrace small imperfections. Focus on the joy of being together. The goal is to create happy memories.

After the main events, wind down. Put on some quiet music. Sit and chat with close friends. Reflect on the day's successes. A peaceful end to the day is important. This ensures you feel refreshed, not exhausted. Your enjoyment makes the holiday better for everyone.
