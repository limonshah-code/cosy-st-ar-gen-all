Traditional wedding send off methods are popular for good reason. They are classic, beautiful, and often create wonderful photo opportunities. We can make these timeless options feel fresh and new. Adding a unique touch helps them fit your wedding theme perfectly.

### Sparkler Exits: A Classic Glow

Sparkler send off ideas remain a favorite. The bright glow of sparklers creates a magical tunnel for your exit. Guests love holding them and cheering you on. For a unique twist, consider longer sparklers for a sustained glow. You can also provide custom matchbooks with your wedding date.

*   **Safety First:** Always have buckets of water or sand ready for used sparklers. Appoint a responsible person to manage them. Tell guests about safety rules before lighting.

*   **Timing is Key:** Plan your sparkler exit for after dark. This makes the light more dramatic. Coordinate with your DJ or band for a specific song to play during the exit.

Instead of just plain sparklers, think about color-changing ones. You could also provide glow sticks for younger guests or those who prefer a less fiery option. This adds variety to the light display. Sparklers offer a truly enchanting exit. This makes them a top choice for couples seeking a memorable finale.

### Confetti and Petal Tosses: Vibrant Farewell

Confetti or petal tosses offer a joyful, colorful send off. They create a beautiful shower as you walk through. This option is often more eco-friendly than other choices. Check with your venue about rules for confetti or petals. Some venues only allow biodegradable options.

*   **Biodegradable Options:** Use dried flower petals, rice paper confetti, or natural leaves. These break down easily and are safe for the environment. They also reduce cleanup time for your venue staff.
