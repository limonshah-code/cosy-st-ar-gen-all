### Concise Answer

Ruler Eyes safety features primarily include high-impact resistant polycarbonate lenses meeting ANSI Z87.1+ and MIL-PRF-31013 standards. They also offer comprehensive UV protection, anti-fog and anti-scratch coatings, and secure, comfortable frames that ensure stable placement during dynamic activities, protecting against ballistic threats and environmental hazards.

## Essential Ballistic Protection: Impact Resistance In Ruler Eyes

When it comes to eye safety, the ability to withstand impact is paramount. The most crucial of the **safety features for the Ruler Eyes** is their exceptional impact resistance. These lenses are not just regular plastic; they are typically made from advanced polycarbonate material. Polycarbonate is a thermoplastic polymer known for its remarkable strength and shatter-resistant properties. It can absorb significant energy without breaking, which is exactly what you need when facing potential fragmentation or stray projectiles.

This material is rigorously tested to meet strict industry standards. The primary standard for eye protection in the United States is ANSI Z87.1+. This certification ensures that the eyewear has passed tests for high-mass and high-velocity impacts. For military and tactical applications, an even higher standard, MIL-PRF-31013, is often met. This military specification requires the lenses to withstand a .15 caliber projectile traveling at incredibly high speeds. Choosing Ruler Eyes that meet or exceed these standards gives me confidence in their protective capabilities. This level of ballistic protection is vital for any shooter, whether at a range or in the field, safeguarding against unforeseen incidents.

### High-Velocity Impact Testing

High-velocity impact testing involves shooting small projectiles at the lenses at specified speeds. This test ensures the lenses will not shatter or dislodge, providing continuous protection. For ANSI Z87.1+, this means a 0.25-inch steel ball fired at 150 feet per second. Ruler Eyes often exceed this, offering enhanced safety.

### High-Mass Impact Testing

High-mass impact testing checks the lens's ability to resist heavier, slower impacts. A pointed projectile, weighing over one pound, is dropped onto the lens from a height of 50 inches. The lens must not crack, chip, or dislodge from the frame. This test replicates impacts from falling objects or blunt forces. Both tests are vital to confirm the strength of the Ruler Eyes.

## Optical Clarity And Visual Performance Features For Ruler Eyes

Clear vision is a safety feature in itself when shooting. **Safety features for the Ruler Eyes** extend beyond just impact resistance; they include advanced optical properties that ensure you see clearly without distortion. Good vision means better accuracy and faster reaction times, which directly contribute to safety. Ruler Eyes are designed to provide a distortion-free field of view. This means that objects you look at through the lenses appear exactly where they are, without bending or warping of lines. Distortion can cause misjudgments of distance or target location, leading to unsafe situations.

To maintain this clarity, several coatings are applied to the lenses. An anti-scratch coating protects the lens surface from abrasions. Scratches on lenses can obscure vision and reduce overall protection by weakening the material. Another vital feature is the anti-fog coating. Rapid temperature changes or strenuous activity can cause lenses to fog up, completely blocking your view. An effective anti-fog treatment ensures your vision remains clear, even in challenging conditions. These optical enhancements work together to provide uncompromised visual performance, allowing me to focus on the task at hand without visual impediments. The quality of optics in Ruler Eyes significantly influences safe and effective shooting.
