VOCs come from cleaning products, paints, and furniture. Coway's activated carbon filters are generally effective for common household odors. Alen often uses a thicker, granulated carbon filter. This provides superior odor absorption for tougher smells. [Finding the best filter for an air purifier makes a big difference.](https://cosyhomecreation.com/best-filter-for-air-purifier)

#### True HEPA Filtration: The Core Difference

Coway's True HEPA filters often include an antimicrobial treatment. This treatment prevents bacteria and mold growth on the filter itself. This adds another layer of cleanliness. Their Green True HEPA filters are designed for long-lasting effectiveness. They also reduce overall energy consumption.

Alen's True HEPA filters are also highly effective. Their filters, like the B4-Pure or FreshPlus, combine HEPA with specialized carbon. Alen focuses on combining filtration layers for specific needs. Some Alen models offer different filter types, like the Pet filter for homes with animals. This customization allows users to tailor filtration to their exact concerns.

#### Activated Carbon Filters: Odor Removal Power

Coway's approach to activated carbon is integrated. Many models feature a combined deodorization filter. This filter works alongside the HEPA layer. It targets common household odors like cooking smells or light pet odors. It is effective for daily air quality improvement.

Alen often takes odor removal more seriously. Many Alen models offer robust activated carbon layers. These layers contain significant amounts of activated carbon granules. This makes them highly effective against strong odors. They can tackle smoke, pet odors, and even chemical fumes. If strong odors are a major concern, Alen's approach often provides superior results. Both brands prioritize clean air, but they achieve it with slightly different filter designs.

### Performance and Coverage: How Coway and Alen Handle Room Sizes

The effectiveness of an air purifier depends on its ability to clean the air in a given space. This is where performance metrics like CADR become important. CADR stands for Clean Air Delivery Rate. It measures how quickly an air purifier removes pollutants from a room. A higher CADR means faster air cleaning.

Both Coway and Alen provide CADR ratings for their models. Coway models, such as the popular Mighty AP-1512HH, offer excellent CADR for their size. These models typically serve medium-sized rooms effectively. Larger Coway Airmega models cover much bigger areas. They ensure quick air purification in larger open-concept spaces.

Alen air purifiers are often known for their powerful airflow and high CADR ratings. The Alen BreatheSmart series, especially the 75i, boasts impressive CADR values. These models are designed to handle very large rooms. They can clean air in big living areas or open floor plans. Choosing the right size ensures your purifier works efficiently. [Finding the best air purifier for a specific room is important.](https://cosyhomecreation.com/best-air-purifier-for-a-room)

#### CADR Ratings Explained

CADR measures how much filtered air an air purifier delivers. It is measured in cubic feet per minute (CFM) for pollen, dust, and smoke. For example, a dust CADR of 200 CFM means the purifier can reduce dust particles in a room as effectively as introducing 200 cubic feet of clean air per minute. When you compare Coway vs Alen, check their CADR for your specific needs. A higher CADR translates to faster air changes.

Coway models like the AP-1512HH Mighty generally have CADR ratings suitable for rooms up to 361 square feet. More advanced Airmega models, such as the 400S, can purify spaces over 1,500 square feet. This range offers flexibility for different home sizes. They provide effective purification for everyday use.

Alen's BreatheSmart purifiers excel in large room coverage. The 45i model covers up to 800 sq ft, and the 75i model covers up to 1,300 sq ft. These high CADR ratings make Alen purifiers ideal for large open spaces or homes with severe air quality issues. They quickly cycle air.

#### Matching Purifier to Room Dimensions

You must match the air purifier's CADR to your room size. For a bedroom or small office, a Coway Mighty might be perfect. It offers good coverage and efficient cleaning. For a large living room or an open-concept kitchen, an Alen BreatheSmart 75i would be more appropriate. It ensures the air gets cleaned multiple times per hour.

Air Changes Per Hour (ACH) is another useful metric. It indicates how many times the air in a room is completely filtered in an hour. Most experts recommend at least 4-5 ACH for optimal air quality. Both Coway and Alen models specify their recommended room sizes based on this metric. They ensure consistent air purification. Consider your specific room dimensions when selecting between these two powerful brands.

### Noise Levels and Energy Efficiency: Quiet Operation and Running Costs

An air purifier runs continuously in your home. This means noise levels and energy consumption are important factors. You want clean air without a constant hum or high electricity bills. Both Coway and Alen address these concerns differently.

Noise levels are measured in decibels (dB). Lower decibel ratings mean quieter operation. Coway models are generally known for their quiet performance on lower fan settings. The Coway Mighty, for example, operates at a very low 24 dB on its lowest setting. This makes it suitable for bedrooms or quiet spaces. On higher settings, the noise increases, but it remains within acceptable limits for most users.

Alen air purifiers often feature "WhisperMax" technology. This technology aims to minimize noise despite powerful airflow. While Alen models can be louder than Coway on their highest settings due to their stronger motors, they remain relatively quiet on lower speeds. The Alen BreatheSmart 75i, for instance, operates around 25 dB on its lowest fan speed. This allows for comfortable use in various home environments.
