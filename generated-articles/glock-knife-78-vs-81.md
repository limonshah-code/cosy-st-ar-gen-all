Glock is a name synonymous with reliability, especially in the firearm industry. But their commitment to tough, functional design extends beyond pistols. Glock knives emerged from a specific military need in the early 1980s. The Austrian Army sought a versatile, robust, and cost-effective combat knife. This led to the creation of the Glock Field Knife.

This knife soon became standard issue for the Austrian military. Its simple, effective design gained wide acceptance. Many other countries and special forces units also adopted it. The knife's reputation grew quickly due to its ruggedness and practical use. I believe this strong foundation in military requirements sets Glock knives apart.

The company built these knives for harsh environments. They designed them to withstand extreme conditions. This focus on durability means a lot to users. When you hold a Glock knife, you feel its purposeful design.

## Glock Knife 78: The Classic Combat Blade

The Glock Knife 78 stands as the original. It represents the foundation of Glock's knife legacy. This model features a classic clip-point blade without a saw on its spine. Its design is straightforward and functional. Many people prefer the clean lines of the 78.

The blade material is spring steel, specifically 1095 carbon steel. This steel offers excellent toughness and edge retention. It also allows for easy sharpening in the field. The blade length measures 6.5 inches. This provides a good balance between reach and maneuverability.

The handle is made from Glock's signature polymer. This material makes the handle incredibly durable. It also offers a secure grip, even when wet. The handle's shape prevents slipping, which is crucial for safety. I find the grip surprisingly comfortable for extended use.
