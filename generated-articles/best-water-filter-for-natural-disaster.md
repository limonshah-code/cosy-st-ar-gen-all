    *   **Rainwater:** Collect rainwater in clean containers. Tarps or plastic sheets can funnel water.
    *   **Rivers and Streams:** These are common sources. Always filter or purify this water.
    *   **Lakes and Ponds:** Similar to rivers, these need purification.
    *   **Swimming Pools:** Untreated pool water can be dangerous. It contains chemicals. It might be a last resort. Use a filter if possible, but be aware of chemical content.
    *   **Toilet Tank:** The water in the toilet tank (not the bowl) is usually clean. It can be a temporary source.
    *   **Hot Water Heater:** Your home's hot water heater holds many gallons of potable water. Turn off the gas/power, then drain it.
    *   **Well Water:** If you have access to a well, it can be a good source. However, check if the well pump needs electricity. If it does, you will need a hand pump or generator. [Consider having a filter specifically for well water](https://cosyhomecreation.com/best-under-sink-filter-for-well-water) if you rely on it daily.

**2. Storing Emergency Water:** The best water is water you already have. Store at least one gallon of water per person, per day. Plan for a minimum of three days. More is better. Use food-grade containers. Keep them in a cool, dark place. Rotate your stored water every six months. This ensures freshness.

**3. Water Purification Tablets:** These tablets are a good backup. They kill bacteria and viruses. They do not remove sediment or improve taste. Use them in conjunction with a filter for best results. They are lightweight and easy to store.

**4. Boiling Water:** If you have a heat source, boiling water is an effective purification method. Bring water to a rolling boil for one minute. This kills most pathogens. Boiling is simple but uses fuel. It also takes time. It does not remove sediment or chemicals.

**5. Building a Comprehensive Disaster Kit:** Your water filter belongs in a larger kit. This kit should include:
    *   First aid supplies.
    *   Non-perishable food.
    *   Flashlights and batteries.
    *   A hand-crank radio.
    *   Warm blankets.
    *   Important documents.
