## Untangling Aussie Mats: Why Your Australian Shepherd's Hair Gets Matted Behind His Ears

You love your Australian Shepherd. Their beautiful, flowing coat is a hallmark of the breed. But sometimes, you find a frustrating problem: their hair is matted behind their ears. This issue causes discomfort for your beloved pet. It can also lead to skin irritation. I understand how concerning this can be for any dog owner.

Matted fur behind an Australian Shepherd's ears is a common problem. It often results from a combination of factors. These include the unique coat type of Australian Shepherds, friction, and moisture. Regular grooming is essential. Knowing the reasons for matting helps prevent it. This article explains why your Australian Shepherd's hair gets matted behind his ears. I will also provide practical steps for prevention and safe removal. We will explore the anatomy of their coat, common culprits, effective grooming techniques, and how to address existing mats. My goal is to help you keep your Aussie's coat healthy and tangle-free.

### Takeaway

*   **Regular Brushing is Key:** Daily brushing, especially around the ears, prevents mat formation.
*   **Use Proper Tools:** A slicker brush and a metal comb are essential for an Australian Shepherd's double coat.
*   **Manage Moisture:** Dry your Aussie's ears thoroughly after baths or swimming to avoid tangles.

*   **Seek Professional Help:** Do not cut out severe mats with scissors; a professional groomer can safely remove them.

### Why Your Australian Shepherd's Hair Gets Matted Behind His Ears

Your Australian Shepherd's hair gets matted behind his ears due to a combination of factors. These include the fine, soft undercoat mixing with the coarser outer coat. This area experiences frequent friction from head movements, scratching, or collar rubbing. Moisture from bathing, swimming, or ear wax can also trap loose fur. Insufficient regular brushing allows these factors to combine, forming tight, painful mats.

## Understanding the Australian Shepherd Coat

Australian Shepherds have a unique coat structure. This structure makes them prone to matting. Their coat is a double coat, meaning it has two distinct layers. The outer coat is medium in texture and water-resistant. This layer protects them from elements. The undercoat is soft and dense. It provides insulation in both warm and cold weather.

The undercoat is especially prone to shedding. This shedding happens throughout the year. It becomes more intense during seasonal changes. Loose undercoat hairs can get caught in the outer coat. They also entangle with live hairs. This entanglement creates knots. These knots quickly turn into mats if not removed. The hair behind the ears is often finer and softer than hair on other parts of the body. This finer texture makes it more susceptible to tangling. The unique coat demands specific grooming practices. Understanding this structure helps you tackle matting effectively.

### The Double Coat's Role in Matting

The double coat of an Australian Shepherd is a beautiful feature. However, it requires significant maintenance. The soft, fluffy undercoat grows close to the skin. It acts as a thermal regulator. The guard hairs of the outer coat are longer and more coarse. They lie over the undercoat. When the undercoat sheds, these loose hairs do not fall out easily. They get trapped within the dense outer coat. This trapped fur is the primary building block for mats.

Mats form when these trapped hairs intertwine. They create tight bundles. The areas behind the ears are particularly vulnerable. The hair here is often thinner and finer. It tangles more readily than the thicker body fur. Regular brushing helps to remove this shedding undercoat. Without this removal, the mats grow larger and tighter. They pull on your dog's skin, causing pain and discomfort. This unique coat demands consistent attention.

## Common Reasons for Matting Behind the Ears

Several factors contribute to **matted hair behind an Australian Shepherd's ears**. It is a common problem for many long-haired breeds. The hair in this specific area is often finer and softer. This makes it more susceptible to tangling than the coarser body hair. Understanding these causes helps you prevent them.

One major cause is friction. Every time your dog shakes his head, scratches, or plays, the hair rubs against itself. This constant rubbing intertwines the individual strands. Collars and harnesses can also contribute to friction. They rub against the fur around the neck and ears. This pressure pushes hair together, creating a perfect environment for mats to form. My Aussie often gets tiny knots right where his collar sits. I have learned to check that spot daily.

Moisture is another significant contributor. When your Australian Shepherd gets wet, their undercoat can clump together. This happens during baths, swims, or even walks in the rain. If the fur is not dried thoroughly, especially behind the ears, it can matt. Water makes the hair stick. As it dries, it binds with loose fur, forming tight knots. Ear wax or discharge can also make the hair sticky. This stickiness attracts dirt and loose fur, leading to matting. Keeping the ears clean is important. You can learn more about when your dog's ears might need cleaning by reading [How Do I Know If My Dogs Ears Need Cleaning](https://cosyhomecreation.com/how-do-i-know-if-my-dogs-ears-need-cleaning).

Finally, a lack of consistent grooming is a key reason. Australian Shepherds have a thick double coat. They need regular brushing to remove loose hair and prevent tangles. Skipping brushing sessions, even for a few days, allows small knots to form. These small knots quickly grow into larger, more severe mats. The hair behind the ears requires special attention during brushing. It is a high-traffic area for tangles.

### Friction and Rubbing

Friction is a major culprit in creating mats behind your Aussie's ears. Your dog's head is constantly moving. He shakes his head when he is happy or when he wants to dry off. He scratches his ears when they itch. Each movement causes the hair strands to rub against each other. This continuous rubbing twists and intertwines the fine hairs. It is similar to how a tangled necklace forms.

Collars and harnesses also contribute to this friction. A collar sits around the neck, often extending close to the ear area. As your Australian Shepherd moves, walks, or plays, the collar rubs against the fur. This constant pressure and rubbing pushes the hair together. It prevents loose hairs from falling out. Instead, they become part of a growing tangle. A well-fitting collar can reduce some friction. However, any contact point can encourage matting. I always make sure my dog's collar is not too tight, but also not too loose to avoid excessive rubbing.

### Moisture and Dirt Accumulation

Moisture significantly increases the likelihood of matting. When your Australian Shepherd's coat gets wet, the hair strands stick together. This happens during baths, swims, or even walks in damp weather. The undercoat, especially, absorbs water and becomes dense. If the fur behind the ears is not dried thoroughly, it clumps as it dries. This clumping binds with any loose hair, creating tight knots. I always towel dry and then use a hairdryer on a cool setting for my Aussie after a bath.

Dirt and debris also play a role. Mud, dust, and tiny plant matter can get trapped in the sticky, damp fur. These particles act like anchors. They help solidify tangles into mats. Ear wax or discharge can also make the hair greasy or sticky. This stickiness attracts more dirt and loose fur. It creates a perfect environment for mats to grow. Regular ear cleaning is important not just for hygiene, but also to prevent matting around the ears.

### Insufficient Grooming Routine

A consistent grooming routine is critical for an Australian Shepherd. Their luxurious double coat requires regular attention. Insufficient brushing is one of the biggest reasons for mats behind the ears. If you do not brush your Aussie frequently enough, loose hair accumulates. It does not fall out naturally. Instead, it gets caught in the living fur.

Small tangles can form quickly. These small tangles grow larger and tighter with every passing day. The hair behind the ears is often forgotten or rushed during grooming. This area is particularly delicate and can be sensitive. It is easy to miss tangles here. Mats start as simple knots. Without proper and consistent brushing, they compact into solid masses. These mats pull on the skin and cause pain. They can also hide skin issues. Make sure to dedicate specific time to this delicate area during each grooming session.

## Preventing Matting: Daily Grooming Habits

Preventing **matted Australian Shepherd hair behind his ears** is much easier than removing existing mats. A consistent and thorough daily grooming routine is your best defense. This includes regular brushing, especially focusing on sensitive areas like behind the ears. I make sure to set aside time every day for this.

Daily brushing is the cornerstone of mat prevention. Australian Shepherds shed continuously. Daily brushing removes loose undercoat before it can tangle. Use the right tools for their double coat. A slicker brush helps remove loose hair and small tangles. A long-toothed metal comb is essential for line brushing. It ensures you reach all the way down to the skin. Pay extra attention to the areas behind the ears, under the legs, and around the tail. These are common matting spots.

Beyond brushing, consider your Aussie's environment and accessories. Check the fit of their collar. A collar that is too tight or too loose can cause friction. This friction encourages matting. Some owners use flat, wider collars or switch to a harness when out. Be mindful of moisture. Thoroughly dry your Australian Shepherd after baths or swims. Even dampness from rain can contribute to tangles. Use a towel and a low-heat hairdryer. Consistent prevention strategies will keep your Aussie comfortable.

### Daily Brushing Techniques

Daily brushing is the most effective way to prevent **matted fur behind your Australian Shepherd's ears**. I make this a priority every single day. Start your grooming session with a full-body brush. Then, focus specifically on the areas prone to matting. The hair behind the ears is delicate. It requires a gentle approach.

Use a slicker brush first. Gently brush outwards from the skin. Work in small sections. This helps to lift loose hair and remove surface tangles. After the slicker brush, use a metal comb. A good quality comb with both wide and narrow teeth is ideal. Start by combing small sections of hair near the ears. Hold the hair closer to the skin with one hand. This prevents pulling on your dog's skin. Comb downwards, working through any small knots you find. The goal is to get the comb through the hair from root to tip. If the comb snags, stop. Do not pull. Gently work through the tangle with your fingers or the comb's wider teeth. This method helps to identify and remove early tangles before they become full mats.

Line brushing is a very effective technique for Australian Shepherds. It ensures you reach the undercoat. To line brush, part your dog's hair horizontally. Brush one section at a time. Hold the top layer of hair up. Brush the section underneath downwards. Work your way across the body, then move up. This meticulous approach gets rid of shedding undercoat that often forms mats. For the ears, lift the ear flap gently. Brush the hair on the underside and behind the ear. This consistent, careful approach prevents severe matting.

### Proper Grooming Tools

Having the right grooming tools is crucial for preventing **matted hair behind an Australian Shepherd's ears**. I have found that investing in good quality tools makes a huge difference. You cannot tackle an Aussie's double coat with just any brush.

Here are the essential tools you will need:

*   **Slicker Brush:** This brush has fine, wire bristles. They are angled to gently remove loose fur and surface tangles. Use it for overall coat maintenance and to lift the undercoat.
*   **Metal Comb (Steel Comb):** A long-toothed metal comb is indispensable. It should have both wide and narrow-set teeth. The wide teeth help with larger tangles. The narrow teeth finish the job, ensuring the coat is clear down to the skin. This comb is essential for line brushing.
*   **De-matting Comb/Tool (Optional, for small tangles):** These tools have sharp blades or serrated edges. They are designed to cut through mats. Use them with extreme caution. They can cut skin easily. I only use mine for very small, stubborn knots. For larger mats, professional help is safer.
*   **Detangling Spray:** A good quality detangling spray can make brushing easier. It lubricates the hair. This reduces friction and helps combs glide through tangles.
*   **Hair Dryer (with cool setting):** After bathing or swimming, thoroughly dry your Aussie. A hair dryer on a cool or low-heat setting helps prevent matting as the hair dries. Blow the hair upwards while brushing to ensure the undercoat is fully dry.

Using these tools correctly will keep your Australian Shepherd's coat healthy and tangle-free. Regular maintenance with the right equipment saves you time and prevents discomfort for your dog. You can learn about grooming vacuums, which can also be helpful, by reading [Best Grooming Vacuum For German Shepherds](https://cosyhomecreation.com/best-grooming-vacuum-for-german-shepherds). While this article mentions German Shepherds, the principles of using a grooming vacuum apply to other double-coated breeds like Australian Shepherds too.

## Dealing with Existing Mats: Safe Removal

Finding **matted Australian Shepherd hair behind his ears** can be alarming. It is important to approach mat removal carefully. Ripping through mats causes pain and can damage your dog's skin. My primary rule is never to use scissors directly on a mat.

The safest way to deal with small, loose mats is gentle de-matting. Start by applying a good quality detangling spray or a small amount of cornstarch to the mat. This helps loosen the hair. Use your fingers to gently pull apart the mat from the outside edges. Work very slowly. Once the mat starts to loosen, use the wide teeth of a metal comb. Work from the ends of the mat towards the skin. Take tiny sections. Do not pull hard. If the mat is stubborn, switch to the narrow teeth of the comb, still working gently. This process requires patience. Praise your dog throughout the process. Give them treats to make it a positive experience.

For larger, tighter, or skin-bound mats, professional help is always recommended. A professional groomer has specialized tools and techniques. They can remove severe mats without harming your dog. Sometimes, shaving the matted area is the only humane option. Trying to cut out large mats with scissors at home is extremely risky. You can easily cut your dog's skin, leading to injury and infection. The skin under mats is often inflamed and thin. It is very easy to make a mistake. Remember that your dog's comfort and safety come first.

The principles apply generally to double-coated breeds.

### Gentle De-Matting Techniques

When you discover a small mat behind your Australian Shepherd's ear, gentle de-matting is key. This approach prioritizes your dog's comfort. Never try to yank or pull at mats. This causes severe pain and can injure their delicate skin.

Here is a step-by-step guide for gentle de-matting:

1.  **Gather Supplies:** You will need a metal comb (with wide and narrow teeth), a slicker brush, a detangling spray, and some dog treats.
2.  **Apply Detangling Spray:** Generously spray the mat and the surrounding hair with a detangling solution. You can also use a small amount of cornstarch. Let it sit for a minute or two to help loosen the hair.
3.  **Isolate the Mat:** Gently separate the matted section from the healthy fur around it. Hold the hair close to your dog's skin (above the mat) with your fingers. This prevents pulling on their skin as you work.
4.  **Finger Pick:** Start by using your fingers to gently pull apart the mat. Work from the outer edges of the mat inwards. Try to separate individual strands or small clumps of hair.
5.  **Comb Through Small Sections:** Once the mat starts to loosen, use the wide teeth of your metal comb. Start at the very ends of the mat and work your way towards the skin. Take very small sections of hair at a time. Gently comb through. If you encounter resistance, stop. Do not force the comb.
6.  **Work Progressively:** As you detangle, switch to the narrower teeth of the comb for finer sections. Continue working slowly and patiently. It is better to take a long time than to hurt your dog.
7.  **Praise and Reward:** Give your Australian Shepherd treats and praise throughout the process. This helps make the experience less stressful for them.
8.  **Brush Regularly:** After removing the mat, ensure you brush that area daily to prevent new mats from forming.

Remember, if the mat is large, very tight, or close to the skin, it is best to seek professional help. A professional groomer can safely shave or carefully cut out the mat without injuring your dog.

### When to Seek Professional Help

Knowing when to seek professional help for **matted Australian Shepherd hair behind his ears** is crucial. Sometimes, mats are too severe for home removal. Trying to tackle large or very tight mats yourself can cause significant pain and injury to your dog.

Here are clear signs that it is time to call a professional groomer or veterinarian:

*   **Large or Tight Mats:** If a mat is larger than your thumb, or if it feels very dense and hard, it is likely too difficult to remove safely at home. These mats often pull on the skin.
*   **Skin-Bound Mats:** Mats that are tight against the skin can cause irritation or hide skin infections. Trying to comb these out can easily tear the skin.
*   **Pain or Discomfort:** If your Australian Shepherd shows signs of pain when you touch the matted area, do not force the removal. This indicates the mat is pulling on their skin.
*   **Multiple Mats:** If your dog has many mats in different areas, a professional grooming session is more efficient and less stressful for your dog.
*   **Lack of Proper Tools/Experience:** If you do not have the right tools, or if you are not confident in your de-matting skills, a professional can do the job safely.
*   **Mats Causing Limping or Restricted Movement:** Severe mats can restrict your dog's movement. They might cause limping if they are in sensitive areas.
*   **Signs of Skin Irritation:** If you notice redness, swelling, sores, or an unpleasant smell coming from under a mat, this could indicate a skin infection. A vet should examine this.

Professional groomers have specialized clippers and experience. They can often shave out mats quickly and safely. This prevents further pain and potential injury. Sometimes, a vet visit is needed if the skin underneath is compromised. Your Aussie's well-being is the top priority.

## Beyond Grooming: Other Factors

While grooming is paramount, other factors can also contribute to **matted Australian Shepherd hair behind his ears**. These elements might not directly cause mats. However, they can worsen the problem or make your dog more prone to them. Understanding these broader influences provides a more complete approach to preventing tangles.

Your Australian Shepherd's overall health plays a role. A healthy coat is less prone to matting. A poor diet lacking essential fatty acids can lead to dry, brittle hair. This type of hair tangles more easily. Skin conditions, allergies, or parasites can cause excessive scratching. This scratching creates friction, which then leads to mats. I always make sure my Aussie eats a high-quality dog food.

Environmental factors are also important. Dry indoor air can make fur more prone to static and tangles. Outdoor activities, like running through brush or tall grass, can introduce burrs and debris. These items quickly get caught in the fur and start mats. Pay attention to their ears. Regular ear checks and cleaning prevent ear infections. Infected or dirty ears can make your dog scratch more, leading to matting around the ear area. [How often should I clean my dogs ears if they are infected](https://cosyhomecreation.com/how-often-should-i-clean-my-dogs-ears-if-they-are-infected) can provide useful information on ear care, which is related to overall health around the ear.

### Diet and Coat Health

Your Australian Shepherd's diet significantly impacts their coat health. A healthy coat is more resilient to matting. A poor diet, lacking essential nutrients, can lead to dull, dry, and brittle fur. This hair type tangles more easily. It also forms mats faster.

Ensure your Australian Shepherd receives a high-quality dog food. Look for foods that list meat as the primary ingredient. They should contain a balanced mix of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids are particularly important for skin and coat health. These "good fats" contribute to a shiny, strong coat. They reduce shedding and improve skin moisture. Sources include fish oil, flaxseed, and certain vegetable oils. You can often find these supplemented in premium dog foods. Sometimes, adding a fish oil supplement to your dog's diet can improve coat quality. Consult your veterinarian before adding any supplements. A healthy diet from the inside out supports a beautiful, tangle-resistant coat.

### Environmental Influences

Environmental factors greatly affect your Australian Shepherd's coat condition. These influences can increase the risk of **matted hair behind his ears**. Being aware of them helps you take preventative measures.

Outdoor adventures are wonderful for an Aussie. However, running through tall grass or dense brush can introduce foreign objects into their coat. Burrs, sticks, and seeds easily get tangled in the fine hair behind the ears. These small pieces of debris act as anchors. They start tangles that quickly become mats. Always check your dog's coat thoroughly after outdoor excursions. Pay extra attention to the areas behind the ears and around the legs.

Indoor environments can also play a role. Dry indoor air, especially during winter months, can make a dog's coat more prone to static. Static electricity makes hair strands repel each other. They then attract dust and other debris. This process can contribute to tangling. Using a humidifier in your home can help add moisture to the air. This reduces static in your dog's coat. A balanced approach, combining daily grooming with awareness of environmental factors, helps maintain your Aussie's beautiful coat.

## Addressing Ear Health and Matting

Ear health is closely linked to **matted hair behind an Australian Shepherd's ears**. Problems with the ears can directly contribute to matting. Your dog's ears are sensitive. Any irritation or infection can cause them to scratch frequently. This constant scratching creates friction, leading to tangles and mats in the surrounding fur.

Regularly inspecting your Australian Shepherd's ears is important. Look for signs of redness, swelling, or discharge. An unpleasant odor is also a key indicator of a potential ear infection. Healthy dog ears should be clean and have no strong smell. If you notice any of these symptoms, consult your veterinarian. An untreated ear infection causes pain. It also leads to excessive head shaking and scratching, making matting worse.

Cleaning your Aussie's ears regularly can help prevent buildup. This buildup can make the fur sticky. Use a vet-approved ear cleaning solution and cotton balls. Never use cotton swabs inside the ear canal. Clean the visible parts of the ear gently. Keeping the ears clean reduces the stickiness that attracts loose hair and dirt. This reduces the likelihood of mats forming close to the ear canal. You can learn more about how to identify ear cleaning needs by reading [How Do I Know If My Dogs Ears Need Cleaning](https://cosyhomecreation.com/how-do-i-know-if-my-dogs-ears-need-cleaning). Proper ear care is part of a comprehensive grooming routine that prevents mats.

## FAQ Section

### How often should I brush my Australian Shepherd?

You should brush your Australian Shepherd daily, especially the areas prone to matting like behind the ears, under the legs, and the tail. Their double coat sheds continuously. Daily brushing removes loose undercoat before it can form tangles and mats. Consistent grooming prevents severe matting and keeps their coat healthy.

### Can I cut out mats with scissors?

No, you should never cut out mats with scissors. It is extremely risky. The skin under mats is often pulled tight and can be inflamed or thin. You can easily cut your dog's skin, leading to severe injury and infection. For severe mats, it is always safest to seek a professional groomer or veterinarian.

### What causes mats specifically behind the ears?

Mats form behind an Australian Shepherd's ears due to several factors. The hair here is often finer and softer, making it prone to tangling. Frequent head movements, scratching, and collar rubbing create friction. Moisture from baths, swimming, or ear wax can also clump hair. Insufficient brushing allows these factors to combine into mats.

### Is matting painful for my dog?

Yes, matting is very painful for your dog. Mats pull on the skin, causing constant discomfort and irritation. They can restrict movement. Severe mats can even lead to skin infections, hot spots, and cuts or tears in the skin if left untreated. Prompt mat removal is essential for your dog's well-being.

### How can I prevent mats from forming after a bath?

To prevent mats after a bath, thoroughly dry your Australian Shepherd. Towel dry first, then use a hairdryer on a cool or low-heat setting. Blow-dry the coat while brushing upwards. This ensures the dense undercoat is completely dry and fluffed. Do not allow the coat to air dry as it can clump and matt.

### What type of brush is best for Australian Shepherds?
