Have you ever wondered about the difference between air fryer vs air roast? Many home cooks ask this question. It seems like both promise crispy, delicious food. But they are not the same. I often get asked which one is better. This article will explain what each cooking method does. We will look at how they work. We will also compare their results and uses.
