Use a soft, dry cloth to wipe down the exterior. For stubborn dirt, a slightly damp cloth can work, but make sure the unit is off and completely dry before turning it on again. Never use harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the casing or internal components.

Battery care is critical for lithium-ion generators. Do not leave the battery fully discharged for long periods. This can reduce its overall lifespan and capacity. Similarly, avoid storing it at 100% charge for extended times if possible. The ideal storage charge level for most lithium-ion batteries is around 50-70%. If you know you will not use the generator for several months, charge it to this level before putting it away. Then, check its charge every few months and top it up if needed. This practice helps maintain battery health over time.

Store your solar generator properly. Always keep it in a cool, dry place. Extreme temperatures, both hot and cold, are detrimental to battery life and electronics. Avoid leaving it in direct sunlight for extended periods when not in use. Garages or sheds can get very hot or cold depending on the season. A climate-controlled closet or shelf inside your home is usually the best option. Protecting it from dust and moisture also prevents internal damage.

Finally, handle the unit with care. Avoid dropping it or subjecting it to heavy impacts. While these units are designed to be portable, they are not indestructible. Treat the ports and cables gently. Forcing plugs can damage the internal connections. If your generator includes a solar panel, maintain that as well. Keep the solar panel clean from dirt, leaves, or snow to ensure maximum charging efficiency. Regular care goes a long way in ensuring your budget solar generator is always ready when you need it, providing reliable power for years to come.
