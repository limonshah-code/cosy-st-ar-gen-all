## Optimal Nutrition: What Do You Feed A Pitbull German Shepherd Mix?

Having a Pitbull German Shepherd mix means you own a unique and powerful dog. These mixes, often called "Shepherd Pits" or "German Pit," combine the strength, intelligence, and energy of two popular breeds. Understanding their specific dietary needs is crucial for their long, healthy life. Proper feeding fuels their active lifestyle and supports their robust build. This guide helps you navigate the world of canine nutrition for your special companion. We will explore nutritional requirements, different food options, feeding schedules, and common challenges.

### Takeaway

*   **Protein is Key:** Ensure high-quality animal protein forms the basis of their diet.
*   **Balance Macronutrients:** Provide a balanced mix of fats, carbohydrates, and essential nutrients.
*   **Consider Life Stage:** Adjust food type and quantity based on age (puppy, adult, senior).
*   **Choose Quality Food:** Opt for reputable brands with clear ingredient lists.
*   **Monitor and Adjust:** Observe your dog's weight, energy, and coat health, then adjust their diet as needed.

To feed a Pitbull German Shepherd mix, choose a high-quality large-breed dog food with real meat as the first ingredient. Ensure it provides adequate protein (25-30%), moderate fat (12-18%), and essential nutrients for their active lifestyle and joint health. Adjust portion sizes based on their age, weight, and activity level.

## Understanding the Nutritional Needs of Your Pitbull German Shepherd Mix

Your Pitbull German Shepherd mix possesses a unique genetic makeup. This mix comes from two highly active and muscular breeds. Therefore, their diet must support high energy levels and strong muscle development. Providing the right nutrients prevents common health issues later in life. We need to focus on specific macronutrients and micronutrients for their well-being.

Both German Shepherds and Pitbulls are prone to certain joint issues like hip and elbow dysplasia. A proper diet can help manage or reduce the severity of these conditions. We should select foods with ingredients that support joint health. This includes specific supplements often found in quality dog foods. Understanding these needs sets the foundation for good feeding practices.

### Protein: The Building Block

Protein is the most important nutrient for your Pitbull German Shepherd mix. It helps build and repair muscles. Active dogs like yours need a higher protein intake. Look for real meat sources like chicken, beef, lamb, or fish listed as the first ingredient.

A diet with at least 25-30% crude protein is ideal for adult mixes. Puppies, growing rapidly, need even more, often around 28-32%. High-quality protein sources are easier for your dog to digest. This ensures they absorb the necessary amino acids for strong muscles and healthy organs.

### Fats: Energy and Skin Health

Fats provide concentrated energy for active dogs. They also support healthy skin and a shiny coat. Look for healthy fats like chicken fat, fish oil, or flaxseed. These fats are rich in Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids.

Omega fatty acids reduce inflammation and support brain function. An ideal diet for your mix should contain 12-18% crude fat. Too little fat leads to low energy. Too much can cause weight gain. This delicate balance is vital for their overall health.

### Carbohydrates: Sustained Energy

Carbohydrates offer sustained energy for your active companion. They also provide fiber for good digestion. Choose complex carbohydrates like sweet potatoes, brown rice, or peas. These are better than simple carbohydrates like corn or wheat.

Complex carbs provide a steady release of energy. They prevent energy crashes throughout the day. Fiber promotes regular bowel movements. It helps maintain a healthy gut microbiome. About 30-40% of their diet can come from healthy carbohydrates.

### Vitamins and Minerals: Essential Micronutrients

Vitamins and minerals are crucial for every bodily function. They support the immune system, bone health, and metabolism. A complete and balanced dog food formula usually provides these. Calcium and phosphorus are essential for strong bones. Glucosamine and chondroitin often appear in large breed formulas.

These joint-supporting ingredients are very beneficial for breeds prone to hip and elbow issues. Consider a food specifically formulated for large breeds to ensure these nutrients are present. This helps prevent future mobility problems. Your veterinarian can offer more insights into specific needs.

## Choosing the Best Commercial Dog Food for Your Mix

Selecting the right commercial dog food can feel overwhelming. The market offers many options. For your Pitbull German Shepherd mix, prioritize quality ingredients and suitability for large, active breeds. Not all dog foods are created equal. You want a product that truly nourishes your dog.

I always recommend reading food labels carefully. Ignore flashy marketing. Focus on the actual ingredient list and nutritional analysis. A good dog food brand often has a dedicated line for large breeds or active dogs. These formulas often contain specific ingredients to support their unique needs, like joint supplements.

### Decoding Dog Food Labels

The ingredient list on a dog food bag tells you everything. Ingredients are listed by weight. The first few ingredients are the most abundant. Look for real meat as the first ingredient. Examples include "deboned chicken," "beef," or "lamb meal." Meat meal is a concentrated form of meat protein. It provides more protein than whole meat after water removal.

Avoid foods with "meat by-products" or "animal digest" as primary protein sources. These are lower quality. Also, watch out for excessive fillers like corn, wheat, or soy. These can cause sensitivities in some dogs. Always check for preservatives; natural ones like tocopherols (Vitamin E) are better than artificial ones.

### Large Breed Specific Formulas

Large breed dog foods are often ideal for your Pitbull German Shepherd mix. These formulas are designed with the growth rate and bone density of larger dogs in mind. They usually have a balanced calcium-to-phosphorus ratio. This helps prevent rapid bone growth, which can worsen joint problems.

These foods also typically include joint supplements. Glucosamine and chondroitin are common additions. They help maintain cartilage health. This is vital for active dogs and those predisposed to hip and elbow dysplasia.

### Wet Food vs. Dry Kibble

Dry kibble is the most common choice. It is convenient and cost-effective. Kibble helps keep teeth clean. Choose a kibble with appropriate size for your dog's mouth. Larger kibble can encourage chewing, not gulping.

Wet food provides more moisture. This helps with hydration. It can be more palatable for picky eaters. However, wet food is more expensive. It also contains more water, meaning less nutrient density per serving. Many owners opt for a mixed diet. They combine dry kibble with a small amount of wet food as a topper.

### Raw and Home-Cooked Options

Some owners explore raw or home-cooked diets. These diets offer fresh ingredients. They allow for complete control over what your dog eats. However, they require careful planning. Nutritional deficiencies can occur if not done correctly.

Raw diets, like BARF (Biologically Appropriate Raw Food), use raw meat, bones, and organs. Home-cooked meals involve preparing cooked meats, vegetables, and grains. Both options require extensive research. They also need consultation with a veterinary nutritionist. This ensures nutritional completeness and safety. Without proper guidance, these diets pose health risks.

## Exploring Raw, Home-Cooked, and Hybrid Diets

Beyond commercial kibble, many owners consider alternative feeding methods. Raw diets, home-cooked meals, and hybrid approaches offer variety and control. Each option has unique benefits and challenges. I find that careful research and professional advice are critical here.

These alternative diets allow you to tailor your dog's meals precisely. You can avoid certain ingredients. You can also address specific health conditions. However, they demand more time and knowledge. Safety and nutritional balance are paramount.

### Understanding Raw Diets (BARF and PMR)

Raw feeding involves giving dogs uncooked ingredients. Two main types exist: Biologically Appropriate Raw Food (BARF) and Prey Model Raw (PMR). BARF diets include raw meat, bones, organs, fruits, and vegetables. PMR diets focus on raw meat, bones, and organs, mimicking a prey animal.

Proponents suggest raw diets lead to shinier coats, cleaner teeth, and better digestion. They believe it aligns more with a dog's ancestral diet. However, raw feeding carries risks. These include bacterial contamination for both dog and human. It also carries the risk of nutritional imbalances if not prepared correctly. You must consult a vet experienced in raw feeding before starting.

### Preparing Home-Cooked Meals

Home-cooked meals offer flexibility. You can prepare fresh, cooked ingredients for your dog. This might include lean meats, cooked grains, and various vegetables. This option lets you control ingredient quality and avoid common allergens. For example, if your dog has sensitivities, you can easily exclude problematic ingredients.

Creating a nutritionally complete home-cooked diet is complex. Dogs need specific ratios of proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. Cooking also affects nutrient content. A veterinary nutritionist can help formulate recipes. They ensure your Pitbull German Shepherd mix receives all necessary nutrients. Without proper formulation, your dog risks deficiencies or excesses.

### Hybrid Feeding Approaches

Hybrid feeding combines commercial kibble with raw or home-cooked elements. This approach offers some benefits of both methods. For example, you might feed kibble for convenience. Then you add fresh meat, cooked vegetables, or specific supplements. This can boost palatability and nutrient diversity.

A hybrid approach allows for dietary flexibility. It can also be more budget-friendly than a full raw or home-cooked diet. Ensure your additions complement the commercial food, not unbalance it. Avoid mixing kibble with raw meat in the same meal, as digestion rates differ. This can cause digestive upset for some dogs. Always introduce new foods slowly to avoid stomach issues.

### Safety and Consultation

No matter which diet you choose, safety is key. For raw and home-cooked diets, proper food handling prevents contamination. Store ingredients correctly. Clean preparation surfaces thoroughly. Always supervise bone consumption if included in a raw diet to prevent choking or splintering.

Consulting a veterinarian or a certified veterinary nutritionist is non-negotiable. They can help you assess your dog's specific needs. They can guide you through diet transitions. They also identify potential health risks. A professional ensures your Pitbull German Shepherd mix gets the best possible nutrition.

## Feeding Schedules and Portion Control for Optimal Health

Establishing a consistent feeding schedule is vital for your Pitbull German Shepherd mix. It aids digestion and prevents overeating. Portion control directly impacts your dog's weight and overall health. An overweight dog faces many health risks. These include joint problems, heart disease, and diabetes.

I always emphasize consistency. Dogs thrive on routine. Feeding at the same times each day helps regulate their digestive system. It also reduces anxiety around meal times. We need to consider age, activity level, and individual metabolism when determining how much and how often to feed.

### Puppy Feeding Schedules

Puppies grow quickly. They need frequent, small meals. A Pitbull German Shepherd mix puppy needs more calories and nutrients than an adult dog. Their developing bodies require constant fuel. For instance, [what do you feed a German Shepherd Pitbull mix puppy](https://cosyhomecreation.com/what-do-you-feed-a-german-shepherd-pitbull-mix-puppy) covers this in more detail.

*   **8-12 weeks:** 3-4 meals per day. Their stomachs are small. They digest food rapidly.
*   **3-6 months:** 2-3 meals per day. As they grow, meal frequency can decrease slightly. You might want to refer to articles like [how do you feed a 3-month-old German Shepherd](https://cosyhomecreation.com/how-do-you-feed-a-3-month-old-german-shepherd) for related insights.
*   **6-12 months:** 2 meals per day. Most puppies transition to an adult schedule around this age, depending on their growth rate.
*   **Beyond 12 months:** 2 meals per day. Most large breeds reach maturity around 12-18 months.

Always follow the feeding guidelines on the puppy food bag. Adjust portions based on your puppy's growth and energy level. Do not let puppies become overweight. Rapid growth puts strain on developing joints.

### Adult Dog Feeding Schedules

Most adult Pitbull German Shepherd mixes do best with two meals per day. This split helps prevent bloat, a life-threatening condition common in deep-chested breeds. It also keeps their energy levels stable throughout the day. Some owners prefer one meal a day. However, two meals are generally safer and more digestible for large, active dogs.

Feed them morning and evening. Stick to these times as closely as possible. Avoid feeding right before or after heavy exercise. This also helps prevent bloat. Give them time to digest their food calmly.

### Determining Portion Sizes

Portion sizes depend on several factors. Dog food bags provide general guidelines based on weight. However, these are just starting points. Your dog's individual needs may vary.

*   **Activity Level:** A highly active mix needs more calories than a less active one. Does your dog spend hours running or mostly lounging?
*   **Metabolism:** Every dog has a unique metabolism. Some burn calories faster than others.
*   **Age:** Growing puppies and senior dogs have different caloric needs. Senior dogs often need fewer calories to maintain weight.
*   **Weight Management:** Regularly weigh your dog. Check their body condition score. You should be able to feel their ribs easily but not see them. They should have a visible waist when viewed from above.
*   **Veterinary Advice:** Always consult your vet. They can provide specific feeding recommendations. They know your dog's health history.

Use a measuring cup to ensure accurate portions. Do not guess. Overfeeding is a common cause of obesity in dogs. Adjust portions gradually if your dog gains or loses weight unintentionally. Monitor their stools for signs of overfeeding or underfeeding (e.g., loose stools from too much food, or very firm, small stools from too little).

## Addressing Common Feeding Challenges and Dietary Concerns

Feeding a Pitbull German Shepherd mix can sometimes present challenges. Picky eating, allergies, and sensitivities are common issues. Recognizing these problems early helps you address them effectively. Your dog's health depends on your ability to adjust their diet as needed.

I often see owners struggle with finding the right food. It requires patience and observation. We need to be vigilant for signs of dietary problems. Prompt action prevents long-term health complications. A veterinarian is always your best resource for severe issues.

### Picky Eaters and Loss of Appetite

Some Pitbull German Shepherd mixes can be picky eaters. Or they may suddenly lose interest in food. First, rule out medical issues. A sudden change in appetite can signal illness. Schedule a vet visit if it persists.

If medical causes are absent, consider these tips:
*   **Vary Food Textures:** Try mixing wet food with kibble. Add a small amount of low-sodium broth.
*   **Warm Food Slightly:** Warming food enhances its aroma. This makes it more appealing.
*   **Establish a Routine:** Feed at specific times. Remove food after 15-20 minutes if not eaten. This teaches them to eat when food is available.
*   **Limit Treats:** Too many treats spoil their appetite for meals. Treats should be a small part of their daily intake.

Do not switch foods too frequently. This can cause stomach upset. Transition new foods slowly over 7-10 days.

### Food Allergies and Sensitivities

Pitbull German Shepherd mixes can develop food allergies or sensitivities. These are different. Allergies involve an immune response. Sensitivities cause digestive upset. Common symptoms include itchy skin, ear infections, paw licking, vomiting, or diarrhea.

Common allergens in dog food include:
*   Chicken
*   Beef
*   Dairy
*   Wheat
*   Soy
*   Corn

If you suspect an allergy, consult your vet. They may recommend an elimination diet. This involves feeding a novel protein source. Examples include duck or venison. You feed this for several weeks. Then you reintroduce old ingredients one by one. This helps identify the culprit. Hypoallergenic or limited ingredient diets (LID) are also options. They contain fewer ingredients to minimize reactions.

### Bloat (Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus)

Bloat is a life-threatening condition. It primarily affects large, deep-chested breeds like German Shepherds. The stomach fills with gas and twists. This cuts off blood supply. Pitbull German Shepherd mixes are at risk.

Signs of bloat include:
*   Distended abdomen
*   Retching without vomiting
*   Restlessness
*   Drooling
*   Painful abdomen

If you suspect bloat, seek emergency veterinary care immediately. Time is critical. To reduce risk:
*   Feed two smaller meals instead of one large one.
*   Do not let your dog exercise vigorously an hour before or after eating.
*   Use a slow feeder bowl. This prevents rapid eating.
*   Avoid elevated feeding bowls unless medically necessary.

Understanding your dog's [behavior of a German Shepherd Pitbull mix](https://cosyhomecreation.com/what-is-the-behavior-of-a-german-shepherd-pitbull-mix) can also help. A dog's stress levels or anxiety might impact how they eat, contributing to bloat risk.

### Weight Management

Maintaining a healthy weight is crucial. Obesity strains joints, heart, and other organs. It shortens lifespan. Underweight dogs lack energy and muscle mass. They may have underlying health issues.

*   **Regular Weight Checks:** Weigh your dog every few months.
*   **Body Condition Score:** Learn to assess your dog's body condition. Feel their ribs, spine, and hip bones. They should have a tuck at the waist.
*   **Adjust Portions:** Reduce food if gaining weight. Increase if losing.
*   **Increase Exercise:** Combine diet changes with more physical activity.
*   **Healthy Treats:** Choose low-calorie treats. Use them sparingly.

Your vet is the best resource for weight management. They can create a tailored plan. They ensure your dog gets proper nutrition while reaching a healthy weight.

## Supplements and Hydration: Essential for Your Mix's Well-being

Beyond their daily food, certain supplements and constant hydration play vital roles in your Pitbull German Shepherd mix's health. These additions can address specific needs or provide extra support. I believe a holistic approach includes more than just primary meals.

Supplements are not a substitute for a balanced diet. They complement it. Always discuss supplements with your veterinarian before introducing them. Hydration is non-negotiable. Water is essential for every bodily function.

### Joint Supplements

Given the predisposition of both parent breeds to joint issues, joint supplements are often recommended. These supplements aim to support cartilage health and reduce inflammation. Common ingredients include glucosamine, chondroitin, and MSM.

*   **Glucosamine:** Helps repair and form cartilage.
*   **Chondroitin:** Gives cartilage elasticity and prevents further breakdown.
*   **MSM (Methylsulfonylmethane):** Reduces inflammation and pain.

Many large-breed dog foods already include these ingredients. However, your vet might suggest additional supplementation. This is especially true as your dog ages or if they show signs of joint discomfort. Fish oil, rich in Omega-3 fatty acids, also supports joint health and reduces inflammation.

### Probiotics and Prebiotics

A healthy gut is essential for overall health. Probiotics are beneficial bacteria. Prebiotics are food for these bacteria. Together, they promote a balanced gut microbiome. This aids digestion and nutrient absorption.

Signs of an unhealthy gut include:
*   Diarrhea
*   Constipation
*   Excessive gas
*   Poor nutrient absorption

You can find probiotics in powder, capsule, or chew form. Some dog foods also contain prebiotics like FOS (fructooligosaccharides) or MOS (mannan-oligosaccharides). Discuss with your vet if your dog experiences chronic digestive upset.

### Omega Fatty Acids

Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids are crucial for your dog's health. They support skin and coat health. They also reduce inflammation. Omega-3s, found in fish oil (EPA and DHA), are particularly beneficial.

Benefits of Omega Fatty Acids:
*   **Shiny Coat and Healthy Skin:** Prevents dryness and itchiness.
*   **Reduced Inflammation:** Helps with allergies and joint pain.
*   **Cognitive Function:** Supports brain development in puppies and cognitive health in seniors.
*   **Heart Health:** Contributes to a healthy cardiovascular system.

You can add fish oil supplements to your dog's food. Look for high-quality, reputable brands. Ensure the product is third-party tested for purity and mercury content.

### Vitamins and Minerals (Additional)

A complete commercial dog food should provide all necessary vitamins and minerals. However, some situations might warrant additional supplementation. For example, if your dog eats a home-cooked diet, specific vitamin and mineral supplements are essential to prevent deficiencies. Pregnant or lactating dogs also have increased needs.

Never over-supplement. Excess of certain vitamins and minerals can be harmful. For example, too much calcium can be detrimental to large breed puppies. Always seek professional veterinary advice before adding any vitamin or mineral supplements.

### The Importance of Hydration

Water is the most critical nutrient. Your Pitbull German Shepherd mix needs constant access to fresh, clean water. Dehydration can quickly lead to serious health problems. Dogs lose water through panting, urination, and defecation. They need to replenish it continually.

*   **Fresh Water Daily:** Change water bowls multiple times a day. Clean the bowl regularly.
*   **Multiple Water Sources:** Place bowls in different areas of your home.
*   **Water on the Go:** Carry water for your dog during walks and outdoor activities.
*   **Recognize Dehydration:** Signs include dry gums, lethargy, sunken eyes, and loss of skin elasticity.

Dogs typically need about one ounce of water per pound of body weight daily. This can increase with activity or hot weather. Encourage drinking, especially after exercise. Access to water bowls and their cleanliness directly affect their desire to drink.

## Life Stages: Feeding Your Pitbull German Shepherd Mix from Puppy to Senior

Your Pitbull German Shepherd mix's nutritional needs change throughout their life. What you feed a growing puppy differs greatly from what you feed an aging senior dog. Adapting their diet to each life stage ensures they receive the specific nutrients required for optimal health. I always remind owners that one-size-fits-all rarely works for long.

Understanding these changes helps you make informed feeding decisions. This supports their energy levels, growth, and overall well-being at every age. Transitioning food types requires care to avoid digestive upset.

### Puppyhood: Fueling Rapid Growth

Pitbull German Shepherd mix puppies grow rapidly. They need a diet high in protein and fat. Puppy-specific formulas are crucial. They have higher calorie counts and specific nutrient ratios for healthy development. For instance, you can learn more about specific needs for a puppy's age, like [what do you feed a 5-month-old German Shepherd](https://cosyhomecreation.com/what-do-you-feed-a-5-month-old-german-shepherd).

*   **High-Quality Protein:** Supports muscle development. Look for 28-32% crude protein.
*   **Controlled Calcium and Phosphorus:** Essential for bone growth. Large breed puppy formulas regulate these minerals. This prevents too-rapid bone growth, which can worsen joint issues.
*   **DHA:** Supports brain and eye development. Often found in fish oil in puppy foods.
*   **Frequent Small Meals:** As discussed, puppies need 3-4 meals daily, gradually reducing to 2.

Monitor your puppy's weight closely. Avoid overfeeding, as excessive weight gain can stress their developing joints. Keep them lean, not chubby.

### Adulthood: Maintaining Peak Performance

Your Pitbull German Shepherd mix reaches adulthood around 12-18 months. At this stage, their growth slows. Their energy needs stabilize. You can transition them to a high-quality adult dog food.

*   **Protein and Fat Balance:** Aim for 25-30% protein and 12-18% fat. This supports their muscle mass and energy levels.
*   **Joint Support:** Continue to prioritize foods with glucosamine and chondroitin. Their active nature puts continuous strain on their joints.
*   **Portion Control:** Adjust portions based on their activity level and weight. Prevent obesity. Active dogs need more calories than couch potatoes.
*   **Consistency:** Stick to a consistent feeding schedule of two meals per day.

I always observe my dog's energy and coat condition. These are good indicators of whether their adult diet is meeting their needs. A dull coat or low energy can suggest nutrient deficiencies.

### Senior Years: Adapting to Slower Metabolism

As your Pitbull German Shepherd mix ages, usually around 7-8 years for large breeds, their metabolism slows down. Their activity levels might decrease. Their dietary needs shift again. Senior dog formulas are specifically designed for this life stage.

*   **Lower Calorie Content:** Prevents weight gain as activity decreases.
*   **Joint Support:** Even higher levels of glucosamine and chondroitin are often beneficial. Arthritis is common in older dogs.
*   **Digestibility:** Senior formulas often use more easily digestible ingredients. This helps with nutrient absorption.
*   **Increased Fiber:** Supports digestive regularity, common issue in older dogs.
*   **Omega-3 Fatty Acids:** Good for cognitive function and reducing inflammation.

My older dogs benefit from softer food textures. If dental issues arise, soaking kibble or feeding wet food becomes necessary. Regular vet check-ups are even more important for senior dogs. They help detect and manage age-related health conditions. Dietary adjustments can play a significant role in their comfort and quality of life.

### Transitioning Between Stages

When transitioning your dog from one life stage formula to another, do it gradually. A sudden change can cause digestive upset.

*   **Day 1-2:** 75% old food, 25% new food.
*   **Day 3-4:** 50% old food, 50% new food.
*   **Day 5-6:** 25% old food, 75% new food.
*   **Day 7+:** 100% new food.

Observe your dog for any signs of digestive upset. Adjust the transition speed if needed. Some dogs have more sensitive stomachs than others. Patience ensures a smooth and healthy transition.

## FAQ Section

### How much food should I feed my Pitbull German Shepherd mix daily?
The amount of food depends on your dog's age, weight, activity level, and the food's calorie density. Always check the feeding guidelines on your dog food bag as a starting point. Most adult mixes eat 3-5 cups of high-quality dry kibble per day, split into two meals. Monitor their body condition; adjust portions to maintain a healthy weight.

### Can my Pitbull German Shepherd mix eat human food?
Some human foods are safe and healthy in moderation. Cooked lean meats, plain vegetables (like carrots, green beans), and certain fruits (apples, blueberries) make good treats. Avoid toxic foods like chocolate, grapes, onions, garlic, and avocado. Always research before sharing any human food.

### What are the signs of a food allergy in a Pitbull German Shepherd mix?
Signs of food allergies often include skin issues like excessive itching, redness, hot spots, or ear infections. Digestive upset, such as vomiting, diarrhea, or gas, can also occur. Paw licking and scooting are common symptoms. If you see these signs, consult your veterinarian for diagnosis and a dietary plan.

### How often should I feed my Pitbull German Shepherd mix puppy?
Pitbull German Shepherd mix puppies should eat 3-4 meals per day until about 3 months old. Reduce this to 2-3 meals daily between 3-6 months. By 6-12 months, most puppies can transition to two meals a day, similar to adult dogs. Consistent meal times are important for digestion and training.

### Is raw feeding safe for a Pitbull German Shepherd mix?
Raw feeding can be safe and beneficial if done correctly. It requires extensive research and careful preparation to ensure nutritional completeness and prevent
