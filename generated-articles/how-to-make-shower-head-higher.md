## Elevate Your Shower Comfort: How To Make Shower Head Higher

Have you ever stepped into your shower only to find the shower head spraying water right at your chest? For many people, especially those who are taller, a low shower head is a daily source of discomfort. It can make rinsing off a struggle, turning a relaxing shower into a contortionist act. You want a refreshing, full-body wash, not a tricky balancing act.

I understand this frustration completely. A perfectly positioned shower head makes a huge difference in your daily routine. It affects how effectively you can wash, how comfortable you feel, and even how much you enjoy your bathroom space. Luckily, you do not need to live with a shower that is too low. There are many practical and effective ways to **make shower head higher**, transforming your shower experience from frustrating to fantastic. This article will show you exactly how to raise your shower head. We will explore various methods, from simple attachments to more involved plumbing changes, giving you the knowledge to find the perfect solution for your home.

### Takeaway

*   **Adjustable Arms and Extenders:** Easily raise your shower head with bolt-on accessories.
*   **Slide Bars:** Add flexibility for handheld shower heads, perfect for various heights.
*   **Replacing the Arm:** A more permanent DIY solution for fixed height increase.
*   **Professional Plumbing:** Consider experts for major height changes or rerouting.
*   **Comfort First:** Choose the method that best suits your needs and skill level.

To make your shower head higher, you can use several methods. These include installing an adjustable shower arm, adding a shower arm extender, or fitting a slide bar for a handheld unit. More permanent options involve replacing the existing shower arm or rerouting the plumbing, often requiring professional help.

## Understanding Your Options to Make Shower Head Higher

Before you grab your tools, it helps to know the different ways you can **make your shower head higher**. Each method has its own benefits and level of difficulty. Some options are quick, simple DIY projects. Others may require more time, effort, or even professional assistance.

The choice depends on your current shower setup, your comfort with home improvement tasks, and your budget. For instance, a simple shower arm extender is affordable and easy to install. Replacing the entire shower arm, however, involves working with plumbing. This might be a job for someone with more experience. We will detail each option. This allows you to pick the best path for your specific needs. Knowing your choices will help you plan your project effectively.

### Common Solutions for Shower Head Height

Several common products and modifications exist to help you **raise your shower head**. These solutions range from temporary fixes to permanent changes. They offer flexibility for various situations. Some methods add a few inches, while others can significantly increase the shower head's height.

*   **Adjustable Shower Arms:** These arms let you move the shower head up and down or forward and back. They are easy to install. You just unscrew your old arm and screw in the new adjustable one.
*   **Shower Arm Extenders:** An extender screws onto your existing shower arm. Your shower head then attaches to the extender. This adds length and raises the head. They come in different sizes to provide varying amounts of height.
*   **Slide Bars with Handheld Showers:** A slide bar mounts to the wall. It has a bracket that holds a handheld shower head. You can slide this bracket up or down the bar to set the desired height. This is great for households with people of different heights.
*   **Replacement Shower Arms:** Sometimes, a longer, fixed shower arm is the best solution. You replace your current short arm with a new, longer one. This provides a clean, permanent height increase without extra attachments.
*   **Plumbing Rerouting:** For the most significant height changes, a plumber can reroute the water supply pipe. This moves the entire shower arm connection point higher on the wall. This is a major renovation.

Each of these options serves a distinct purpose. They offer different levels of commitment and cost. I find that starting with the simplest solution is often the best approach. If that does not meet your needs, then you can explore more involved methods.

## Method 1: Installing an Adjustable Shower Arm

One of the simplest and most popular ways to **make shower head higher** is by installing an adjustable shower arm. This type of arm often has pivot points or telescoping sections. These features let you position the shower head exactly where you want it. It is a fantastic solution for households with different heights. Everyone can enjoy a comfortable shower.

I particularly like this method because it offers great flexibility. You can angle the water spray directly over your head. This prevents uncomfortable bending or squatting during your shower. Most adjustable arms are designed for easy DIY installation. They do not require any specialized tools or extensive plumbing knowledge. This makes it an accessible upgrade for many homeowners.

### Steps to Install an Adjustable Shower Arm

Installing an adjustable shower arm is a straightforward process. You do not need to be a professional plumber to complete this task. I have done this myself, and it makes a noticeable difference in shower comfort. Here is how you can do it:

1.  **Gather Your Tools:** You will need a wrench or pliers, Teflon tape (plumber's tape), and a cloth. Make sure you have your new adjustable shower arm ready.
2.  **Turn Off the Water:** This is a crucial first step. Turn off the main water supply to your house or just to the bathroom. This prevents any accidental leaks while you work. I always double-check the water is off before touching anything.
3.  **Remove the Old Shower Head:** Unscrew your existing shower head from the shower arm. Twist it counter-clockwise. You might need a wrench if it is tight.
4.  **Remove the Old Shower Arm:** Grip the shower arm firmly near the wall plate. Turn it counter-clockwise with a wrench or pliers. Be careful not to twist the pipe inside the wall. If the arm is stuck, you may need a bit more leverage. Sometimes, old arms are difficult to remove. If you [can't unscrew your shower head](https://cosyhomecreation.com/cant-get-shower-head-to-unscrew) or arm, try penetrating oil or gentle heat.
5.  **Clean the Threads:** Once the old arm is off, clean any old tape or sealant from the threaded pipe coming out of the wall. This ensures a good seal with the new arm.
6.  **Apply Teflon Tape:** Wrap new Teflon tape clockwise around the threads of the pipe coming from the wall. Apply three to four layers. This creates a watertight seal. Do this for the new shower arm's threads as well, where it connects to the shower head.
7.  **Install the New Adjustable Arm:** Screw the new adjustable shower arm into the pipe coming from the wall. Turn it clockwise until it is hand-tight. Then, use a wrench for one or two more turns. Do not overtighten, as this can damage the pipe.
8.  **Attach the Shower Head:** Screw your shower head onto the end of the new adjustable arm. Hand-tighten it, then give it a small turn with a wrench. Make sure the arm is in the position you want it.
9.  **Restore Water Supply and Check for Leaks:** Turn the water supply back on slowly. Check for any leaks around the connections. If you see drips, tighten slightly until they stop.
10. **Adjust for Comfort:** Now, adjust the new shower arm to your desired height and angle. Test it out to ensure it provides a comfortable spray.

This simple upgrade can significantly improve your showering experience. It provides the flexibility you need.

## Method 2: Using a Shower Arm Extender

Another effective and popular solution to **make shower head higher** is to install a shower arm extender. These devices attach directly to your existing shower arm. They add several inches of height and often allow for greater adjustability. Think of it as a bridge that lifts your shower head up. Extenders are a great choice if you do not want to replace the entire shower arm or if you need a quick height boost.

I find extenders to be very user-friendly. They come in various lengths and styles, allowing you to pick one that matches your bathroom's aesthetic. Most extenders also include pivot points or ball joints. These features enable you to adjust the angle and direction of your shower spray. This makes for a much more comfortable and personalized shower experience. This method is generally very affordable and requires minimal tools.

### Installing a Shower Arm Extender

Adding a shower arm extender is a simple task that most people can complete in under 30 minutes. It is a quick win for those seeking to **raise their shower head** without a major renovation. Here is my step-by-step guide for installation:

1.  **Gather Supplies:** You will need the shower arm extender, Teflon tape, and a wrench or pliers. A clean cloth is also useful.
2.  **Turn Off Water Supply:** Always start by turning off the water to your shower. You can usually do this at the main water shut-off valve for your home or a dedicated shut-off for your bathroom. Confirm the water is off by turning on the shower.
3.  **Remove Shower Head:** Carefully unscrew your current shower head from the existing shower arm. Turn it counter-clockwise. If it is stubborn, a wrench can help, but be gentle to avoid damaging the arm. Sometimes [you cannot get the shower head off](https://cosyhomecreation.com/can-not-get-shower-head-off). In this case, you might need to use a penetrating lubricant or try specific techniques to [loosen the shower head](https://cosyhomecreation.com/how-to-loosen-shower-head).
4.  **Prepare Extender Threads:** Take your shower arm extender. Wrap Teflon tape clockwise around the male threads of the extender. This is the end that will screw into your existing shower arm. Apply three to four layers of tape for a good seal.
5.  **Attach Extender to Shower Arm:** Screw the extender onto the end of your existing shower arm. Turn it clockwise until it is hand-tight. Then, use a wrench to tighten it another half to one full turn. Do not overtighten, as this can strip the threads or damage the pipe.
6.  **Prepare Shower Head Threads:** Now, wrap Teflon tape clockwise around the male threads on the other end of the extender. This is where your shower head will attach. Again, three to four layers work best.
7.  **Attach Shower Head to Extender:** Screw your shower head onto the end of the extender. Hand-tighten it, then use a wrench for a final snug turn. Make sure the shower head is pointing in the right direction.
8.  **Restore Water and Check for Leaks:** Slowly turn the water supply back on. Watch for any drips or leaks at both connection points. If you see any leaks, tighten the connections slightly until they stop.
9.  **Adjust Extender:** Position the extender and shower head to your desired height and angle. Test the water flow to ensure everything works correctly and provides a comfortable spray.

This method is quick, effective, and minimally invasive. It provides a significant improvement in shower head height.

## Method 3: Implementing a Slide Bar with Handheld Shower

For ultimate flexibility in shower head height, especially in households with varying user heights, a slide bar system with a handheld shower is an excellent choice. This method allows you to easily adjust the shower head's position up or down the bar, catering to everyone from young children to tall adults. It offers much more versatility than fixed shower heads or even simple extenders.

I often recommend this option because it is not just about making the shower head higher; it is about making it *adjustable* on demand. A slide bar also adds the benefit of a handheld shower, which is great for cleaning the shower, washing pets, or assisting with bathing. It provides a truly customizable showering experience. While it involves drilling into your shower wall, the installation is manageable for a dedicated DIYer.

### Installing a Slide Bar System

Installing a slide bar system requires a bit more effort than simply screwing on an extender. It involves drilling holes into your shower wall, so careful planning is essential. I always measure twice and drill once! Here is how to install one:

1.  **Gather Tools and Materials:** You will need the slide bar kit, a drill, drill bits appropriate for your wall material (tile, fiberglass, etc.), a level, a pencil, a measuring tape, Teflon tape, and a wrench.
2.  **Turn Off Water Supply:** Shut off the main water supply to your home or bathroom. This prevents any accidental water flow during installation.
3.  **Remove Existing Shower Head and Arm (Optional):** If you are replacing a fixed shower head, remove it from the arm. You might also choose to remove the entire arm if you plan to cap it off. However, most slide bar installations keep the existing shower arm as the water source for the handheld unit. If you need to [change your shower head in an apartment](https://cosyhomecreation.com/how-to-change-shower-head-in-an-apartment), this method is a good option as it often allows you to keep the original setup intact.
4.  **Determine Placement:** Hold the slide bar against the wall. Use a pencil to mark the desired height for the top and bottom mounting brackets. Consider the height of all users. Use a level to ensure the marks are perfectly vertical. The shower hose will connect to your existing shower arm. Make sure it reaches comfortably.
5.  **Drill Pilot Holes:** Carefully drill pilot holes at your marked spots. Use the correct drill bit for your wall material. Start with a smaller bit and increase the size if needed, following the slide bar kit's instructions.
6.  **Insert Wall Anchors:** If your kit includes wall anchors, insert them into the drilled holes. Tap them gently with a hammer until they are flush with the wall surface. These provide a secure grip for the screws.
7.  **Mount Brackets:** Attach the mounting brackets to the wall using the screws provided in the kit. Tighten them firmly, but do not overtighten, especially on tile.
8.  **Install Slide Bar:** Secure the slide bar into the mounted brackets. Some bars clip in, others screw in at the ends. Follow your kit's specific instructions.
9.  **Connect Shower Hose:** Attach one end of the shower hose to your existing shower arm or diverter. Wrap the threads with Teflon tape first. Attach the other end of the hose to the handheld shower head.
10. **Install Handheld Holder:** Slide the handheld shower holder onto the bar. This holder usually has a button or lever to adjust its position.
11. **Restore Water and Check for Leaks:** Turn the water supply back on slowly. Check all connections for leaks. Adjust any loose connections if needed.
12. **Test and Adjust:** Place the handheld shower head in its holder. Slide it up and down the bar to ensure it moves smoothly. Test the water flow and enjoy the newfound flexibility.

This system provides unparalleled height adjustability, making your shower truly comfortable for everyone.

## Method 4: Replacing the Existing Shower Arm for More Height

If you are looking for a more permanent and cleaner solution to **make shower head higher** without visible extenders or slide bars, replacing your existing shower arm with a longer one is a great option. This method provides a fixed increase in height. It maintains a sleek, integrated look in your shower. It is particularly useful if your current shower arm is very short or positioned too low in the wall.

I consider this a medium-difficulty DIY task. It requires a bit more care than simply adding an extender. You must ensure you do not damage the pipe inside the wall. However, with the right tools and a careful approach, it is definitely achievable for a homeowner. The result is a much more comfortable showering height. This allows the water to flow over you without bending or ducking.

### Steps to Replace Your Shower Arm

Replacing a shower arm is a definite upgrade if you need a static height increase. It can transform your showering experience significantly. Here is how I would approach this task:

1.  **Gather Supplies:** You will need a new, longer shower arm, Teflon tape, a wrench (pipe wrench or adjustable wrench), a sturdy cloth or rag, and possibly penetrating oil if the old arm is stuck. I also like to have a small bucket for any drips.
2.  **Turn Off Water Supply:** This is the most important first step. Locate the main water shut-off valve for your home or the specific shut-off for your bathroom. Turn it off completely. Verify no water flows by turning on the shower.
3.  **Remove the Old Shower Head:** Unscrew your current shower head from the existing shower arm. Turn it counter-clockwise. You may need a wrench if it is tightly secured.
4.  **Remove the Old Shower Arm:** This is the most critical part. Wrap a sturdy cloth around the existing shower arm where it enters the wall. Grip it firmly with your wrench. Turn the wrench counter-clockwise to unscrew the arm from the pipe fitting inside the wall. Apply steady, firm pressure. Be careful not to twist or damage the pipe inside the wall. If the arm is really stuck, applying some penetrating oil to the threads and letting it sit for a while can help. Sometimes, if it's very old, you might even consider methods like [how to get an old shower head off](https://cosyhomecreation.com/how-to-get-an-old-shower-head-off) or techniques for when you [can't unscrew your shower head](https://cosyhomecreation.com/can-t-unscrew-shower-head). These techniques can sometimes apply to the arm as well.
5.  **Clean the Threads:** Once the old arm is out, inspect the pipe threads coming out of the wall. Clean off any old Teflon tape, pipe dope, or mineral deposits. Use a small wire brush or a utility knife if needed. Clean threads ensure a tight seal with the new arm.
6.  **Apply Teflon Tape to New Arm:** Take your new, longer shower arm. Wrap Teflon tape clockwise around the male threads of the arm that will screw into the wall fitting. Apply three to four layers for a strong, watertight seal.
7.  **Install the New Shower Arm:** Carefully screw the new shower arm into the wall fitting. Turn it clockwise by hand until it is snug. Then, use your wrench to tighten it another one to two full turns. Position the arm so the shower head end points slightly downward, allowing for proper drainage. Again, avoid overtightening.
8.  **Attach the Shower Head:** Wrap Teflon tape around the male threads on the end of the new shower arm where the shower head attaches. Screw your shower head onto these threads. Hand-tighten, then use a wrench for a final snug turn.
9.  **Restore Water Supply and Check for Leaks:** Slowly turn the water supply back on. Closely inspect all connections for any leaks. If you see drips, gently tighten the connection until the leak stops.
10. **Test the New Height:** Turn on the shower to test the water flow and the new height. Enjoy your more comfortable showering experience.

This upgrade provides a clean, permanent solution for those needing a higher fixed shower head. It looks professional and functions perfectly for tall users.

## When to Call a Professional: Plumbing Rerouting and Major Changes

Sometimes, simple DIY solutions like extenders or new shower arms are not enough to **make shower head higher**. This is often the case if your shower pipe is simply too low within the wall itself. For instance, if you live in an older home or if the original plumbing was installed at a non-standard height. In these situations, you might need a more significant change: rerouting the plumbing.

I always advise homeowners that if a project feels beyond their skill level, it is best to call a professional. Plumbing rerouting means opening up walls, cutting and soldering pipes, and ensuring everything is perfectly sealed to prevent leaks. This work requires specific tools, extensive knowledge of plumbing codes, and considerable experience. Attempting such a major renovation without the proper expertise can lead to costly water damage or unsafe installations. A professional plumber ensures the job is done correctly, safely, and up to code. This saves you headaches and potential future repairs.
