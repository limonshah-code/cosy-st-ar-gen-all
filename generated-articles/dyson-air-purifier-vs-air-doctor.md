This makes Air Doctor a strong choice for homes with specific chemical sensitivities or strong odors.

### Performance Metrics: CADR, Room Size, and Air Changes Per Hour

Understanding performance metrics helps you choose the right purifier size. CADR stands for Clean Air Delivery Rate. It measures how quickly a purifier removes pollutants from a room. A higher CADR means faster cleaning. Room size coverage indicates the maximum area a unit can effectively purify. Air Changes Per Hour (ACH) tells you how many times the air in a room is completely replaced.

Dyson provides CADR ratings for its purifiers. These ratings vary by model. Their purifiers are often designed for medium to large rooms. Some Dyson models excel in specific room sizes. For example, you might consider [the best Dyson air purifier for a large room](https://cosyhomecreation.com/best-dyson-air-purifier-for-large-room) if you have an open living space. Dyson's Air Multiplier technology helps circulate purified air widely. This contributes to efficient room coverage.

Air Doctor also publishes CADR ratings for its units. They typically offer models for various room sizes, from small bedrooms to very large open-plan areas. Air Doctor often emphasizes a high number of air changes per hour. For instance, their larger models might clean the air 4-5 times per hour in a specified room size. This rapid air exchange ensures quick removal of airborne contaminants. When comparing, check the CADR for pollen, dust, and smoke. This gives a clearer picture of their specific cleaning power.
