## Sizing Your Generator: What 13000 Watts Can Power

Knowing what a 13000-watt generator can power is essential. This wattage provides substantial home backup. It handles most household appliances. For example, you can run a central air conditioner. A typical 3-ton AC unit needs about 3500-5000 running watts. Its starting watts are higher. A 13000-watt generator covers this.

You can power a refrigerator, freezer, and well pump. These are critical during an outage. Kitchen appliances like a microwave or coffee maker also run easily. Entertainment systems and multiple lights remain operational. This allows a comfortable living situation.

To calculate your exact needs, list all appliances. Find their running and starting watts. Add up the running watts for all items you want to use simultaneously. Make sure this total is below 13000 watts. Then, identify the appliance with the highest starting wattage. Ensure your generator's starting watts can handle this surge.

For example, I might need to run:
*   Refrigerator: 800 watts (running), 2000 watts (starting)
*   Sump Pump: 1000 watts (running), 3000 watts (starting)
*   Lights and small electronics: 1000 watts (running)
*   Well Pump: 1500 watts (running), 4500 watts (starting)
*   Microwave: 1200 watts (running)

Total running watts: 800 + 1000 + 1000 + 1500 + 1200 = 5500 watts. The largest starting load is the well pump at 4500 watts. A 13000-watt running and 15000-watt starting generator easily powers this. This allows you to live almost normally during an outage.
