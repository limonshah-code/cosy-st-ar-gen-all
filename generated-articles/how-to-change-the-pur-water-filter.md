Knowing **how to change the PUR water filter** is key to keeping your system working its best.

This guide will show you how to change your PUR water filter. We will cover different types of PUR systems. We will explain when to replace your filter. You will get clear, step-by-step instructions. We will also share tips for maintaining your PUR system. Keeping your filter fresh means your water stays fresh. Let's make sure your home enjoys clean water every day.

### Takeaway

Changing your PUR water filter is a straightforward task. It helps maintain water quality and extends your filter system's life.
*   Check the indicator light or monitor water taste and flow.
*   Gather necessary supplies before starting.
*   Follow specific steps for pitcher, dispenser, or faucet filters.
*   Always flush the new filter and reset the indicator light.
*   Regular replacement ensures continuous access to cleaner, better-tasting water.

Changing a PUR water filter involves simple steps. First, prepare the new filter by soaking or flushing it. Next, remove the old filter from its housing. Then, insert the new filter firmly and ensure it fits well. Finally, flush the system to activate the filter and reset any indicator lights. This process ensures your water remains clean and fresh.

## Understanding Your PUR Water Filter System

PUR offers different types of water filter systems. Each system is designed to meet specific needs. Knowing which type you own helps you understand how to change its filter. These systems include pitchers, dispensers, and faucet mounts. Each design has its own unique filter change process.

PUR pitcher filters are common. People use them to filter small batches of water. You fill the pitcher with tap water. The water goes through the filter and collects in the bottom chamber. These filters are small and easy to swap out. They are good for personal use or small families.

PUR dispenser filters hold more water. These are like larger pitchers. They sit on a countertop or inside a refrigerator. You can dispense filtered water directly from a tap on the unit. Their filters are often similar to pitcher filters but can be larger. They provide filtered water on demand without needing to refill a small pitcher often.

PUR faucet filters attach directly to your kitchen tap. This allows you to get filtered water instantly. You can switch between filtered and unfiltered water with a simple lever. Faucet filters are convenient for drinking and cooking. They require a specific method for replacement, different from pitchers or dispensers. Knowing your model helps you prepare for the change. Each system works to give you cleaner water.

### PUR Pitcher and Dispenser Filters

These filters work by gravity. Water flows down through the filter cartridge. Contaminants get trapped inside the filter media. The filtered water collects below. Filter replacement involves simply pulling out the old cartridge and pushing in the new one. This design makes the process very simple.

### PUR Faucet Mount Filters

These filters use water pressure from your tap. The water flows through the filter housing. A lever directs water either through the filter or around it. Changing these filters usually means twisting off the filter housing. Then you replace the cartridge inside. This system gives you filtered water without waiting for it to drip.

## When to Change Your PUR Water Filter

Knowing when to change your PUR water filter is important. A fresh filter ensures you always have clean water. Using an old filter can lead to less effective filtration. It can also affect the taste of your water. There are clear signs that tell you it is time for a change.

Most PUR systems have a filter life indicator. This is often a small light on the unit. For pitchers and dispensers, it might be on the lid. For faucet mounts, it is on the filter housing itself. This light changes color to tell you the filter status. Green usually means good. Yellow means it is getting low. Red means it is time to change the filter. Always pay attention to this indicator. It is the easiest way to know when to act.

Beyond the indicator light, your senses can also tell you. The taste of your water might change. It might start to taste like tap water again. You might notice an odd smell. These are signs the filter is no longer doing its job. The flow rate can also slow down. If it takes a long time for water to pass through the filter, it is likely clogged. A clogged filter struggles to let water pass.

PUR recommends changing filters regularly. For most pitcher and dispenser filters, this is every 2 months or 40 gallons. For faucet filters, it is typically every 2 to 3 months or 100 gallons. These are general guidelines. Your actual usage affects filter life. If you have very hard water or use a lot of water, you might need to change it sooner. Always check the specific recommendations for your PUR model. Regular changes mean continuous access to clean, good-tasting water. Knowing [how long does a PUR water filter last](https://cosyhomecreation.com/how-long-does-a-pur-water-filter-last) helps you plan your replacements.

### The Filter Indicator Light

This light is your primary guide. When it turns red, it means the filter needs immediate replacement. Do not ignore this signal. It ensures your water is always filtered effectively. The light tracks usage, not just time.

### Signs of a Worn Filter

If your water tastes strange, or the flow rate decreases, change your filter. These are direct signs the filter media is no longer working. Do not wait for the light if you notice these changes. Trust your senses.

## Gathering Your Supplies for a PUR Filter Change

Before you start changing your PUR water filter, gather everything you need. Having your supplies ready makes the process smooth. It saves you time and prevents interruptions. You do not want to be halfway through and realize you forgot something. This step is simple but important for an easy filter swap.

First and most importantly, you need a new PUR replacement filter. Make sure it is the correct type for your system. PUR filters come in different models for pitchers, dispensers, and faucet mounts. Check the model number of your existing filter or system. This ensures the new filter will fit properly. You can find this information on your current filter packaging or on the PUR website. Do not try to force a wrong filter.

You will also need a clean sink or a large basin. This is to catch any water that spills during the change. Filters, especially old ones, can drip. A basin keeps your countertop dry. Have a few clean paper towels or a cloth ready. These are useful for wiping up spills. They can also clean the filter housing.

For faucet mount filters, you might need a small tool. Sometimes, a flat-head screwdriver or a coin helps to open the housing. Check your specific faucet mount model's instructions. Some models are hand-tightened, while others need a little help. You usually do not need tools for pitcher or dispenser filters.

Finally, have some tap water ready. You will need to flush the new filter. This removes any carbon dust from manufacturing. It also prepares the filter for use. A clean space to work helps. Make sure you have enough light. With these items prepared, you are ready to change your filter without fuss. This simple preparation ensures a quick and effective filter replacement.

*   **New PUR Replacement Filter:** Ensure it is the correct model for your pitcher, dispenser, or faucet.
*   **Clean Sink or Basin:** To catch water drips and spills during the process.
*   **Paper Towels or Clean Cloth:** For wiping up any water and cleaning the filter housing.
*   **Small Flat-Head Screwdriver or Coin (for some faucet models):** Check your specific faucet filter's manual if a tool is needed for removal or installation.
*   **Tap Water:** For flushing the new filter before its first use.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Changing a PUR Pitcher or Dispenser Filter

Changing a PUR pitcher or dispenser filter is very easy. You can do it in just a few minutes. This ensures you always have clean, fresh water ready to drink. Follow these steps for a smooth filter replacement.

First, prepare your new filter. Remove the new PUR filter from its packaging. You need to pre-soak it. Submerge the new filter in cold water for about 15 minutes. This step is important. It helps remove any carbon dust from the filter. It also prepares the filter media for optimal performance. Some newer filters might not need soaking, so always check the specific instructions on your filter's box.

Next, remove the old filter. If your pitcher or dispenser has water in it, empty it out. Then, open the lid. Locate the filter compartment. The old filter usually pulls straight out or twists slightly to release. It might be a little stiff, but do not force it too hard. Once removed, discard the old filter. You can recycle some parts depending on local rules.

Now, install the new filter. After soaking, insert the new filter into the filter compartment. Make sure it aligns correctly. Push it down firmly until it clicks into place. You should feel it seat securely. A good fit ensures water only passes through the filter. Close the lid of your pitcher or dispenser.

Finally, flush the new filter and reset the indicator. Fill the pitcher or dispenser with cold tap water. Let the water filter through. Discard this first batch of filtered water. This initial flushing helps remove any remaining carbon particles. Repeat this flushing process once or twice more. This fully activates the filter. After flushing, reset your filter indicator light. Hold down the reset button until the light turns green. This tells the system you have a new filter. Now your PUR pitcher or dispenser is ready to provide clean, great-tasting water again.

### Preparing the New Filter

Unpack the new filter. Submerge it in cold water. Let it soak for 15 minutes. This primes the filter and gets it ready for use. Always check the packaging for specific soaking instructions, as some models vary.

### Removing the Old Filter

Empty any water from the pitcher or dispenser. Open the lid. Gently pull or twist the old filter to release it. Discard the used filter properly. A firm but gentle tug often works best.

### Installing the New Filter

Take the soaked filter. Align it with the opening. Push it firmly into the compartment until it clicks or seats securely. Ensure a snug fit to prevent water from bypassing the filter media.

### Flushing and Resetting

Fill the pitcher with tap water. Let it filter through. Discard the first two full pitchers of filtered water. This flushes out loose carbon. Then, locate the reset button. Hold it down for a few seconds until the light turns green. This updates the filter's life tracker.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Changing a PUR Faucet Mount Filter

Changing a PUR faucet mount filter is different from pitchers. It connects directly to your tap. This makes the process unique but still simple. Follow these steps to replace your faucet filter quickly.

First, prepare your work area. Make sure the water supply to your faucet is off. You do not need to turn off the main water to your house, just ensure the tap is closed. Have a cloth or paper towels ready for any drips. It is also good to have a small container nearby for the old filter.

Next, detach the old faucet filter. Locate the filter housing on your faucet mount. There is usually a release button or a twist mechanism. For many PUR faucet models, you twist the entire filter housing counter-clockwise. Some models might have a small button to push first. Apply firm but gentle pressure. The housing should unlatch or unscrew from the faucet base. Once loose, pull the old filter cartridge out from inside the housing.

Now, prepare the new filter. Unpack your new PUR faucet filter. It is often recommended to pre-flush these filters. Hold the new filter under cold running water for 15 seconds. This helps activate the carbon. It also removes any loose carbon dust. Some filters might not need this step, so check your specific filter's instructions.

Then, attach the new faucet filter. Insert the new filter cartridge into the filter housing. Make sure it seats properly. The filter usually has a specific orientation, so align it carefully. Once the filter is inside, reattach the filter housing to the faucet base. Twist it clockwise until it clicks or locks securely into place. Ensure it is tight to prevent leaks. Do not overtighten, as this can damage the unit.

Finally, flush the system and reset the indicator. Turn on your cold water tap. Allow the water to flow through the filter for five minutes. This flushes out any air or remaining carbon dust. It also activates the filter. During this flush, check for leaks around the housing. If you see leaks, tighten the housing gently. After flushing, reset the filter indicator light. This button is usually on the front of the faucet mount. Press and hold it until the light turns green. Your PUR faucet filter is now ready to provide fresh, filtered water.

### Detaching the Old Faucet Filter

Turn off your faucet. Locate the filter housing. Twist the housing counter-clockwise or press the release button. Carefully pull the old filter cartridge out. Dispose of the old filter properly.

### Attaching the New Faucet Filter

Flush the new filter under cold water for 15 seconds. Insert the new filter cartridge into the housing. Align it correctly. Twist the housing clockwise onto the faucet base until it locks. Ensure a secure fit to avoid leaks.

### Flushing the System

Turn on the cold water. Let it run through the new filter for 5 minutes. This removes carbon dust and air. During this flush, check for any leaks. Reset the filter indicator light by pressing and holding the button until it turns green. Your system is now ready for use.

## Troubleshooting Common PUR Filter Issues

Even with careful filter changes, you might encounter small issues. Knowing how to troubleshoot these problems can save you time. It helps ensure your PUR system works correctly. Most issues have simple solutions.

One common issue is slow water flow. If water takes a long time to pass through the filter, it often means the filter is clogged. This happens when the filter has collected too many contaminants. The solution is usually to replace the filter. Even if the indicator light is not red yet, slow flow is a clear sign. A new filter will restore the normal flow rate.

Another problem can be leaks. If you see water dripping from your pitcher, dispenser, or faucet mount after a filter change, check the seal. For pitchers and dispensers, ensure the filter is seated firmly. For faucet mounts, make sure the housing is tightened correctly. Sometimes, the O-ring inside the faucet mount housing might be out of place or damaged. Re-seat it or replace it if needed. Do not overtighten, as this can also cause leaks.

The filter indicator light might not reset. After installing a new filter, you always reset the light. If it stays red or does not change, you might not have held the button long enough. Try pressing and holding the reset button again for several seconds. Make sure the filter is properly seated. If the filter is not fully in place, the sensor might not recognize it. Re-seat the filter and try resetting again. If the light still does not reset, contact PUR customer support for help.

Sometimes, new filters have an unusual taste. This is usually due to carbon dust. This taste should go away after a few flushing cycles. Make sure you flush the new filter thoroughly before use. This is why discarding the first few batches of water is important. If the taste persists, you might have a defective filter. In that case, contact PUR for a replacement. Addressing these issues helps maintain your water quality. When considering the [best filter for a water purifier](https://cosyhomecreation.com/best-filter-for-water-purifier), ensuring proper installation and troubleshooting is key for optimal performance.

*   **Slow Water Flow:**
    *   **Solution:** Replace the filter. The old filter is likely clogged with contaminants.
*   **Leaks After Filter Change:**
    *   **Solution:** Check filter seating (pitcher/dispenser). Ensure faucet mount housing is tightly, but not overly, screwed on. Inspect O-rings for proper placement or damage.
*   **Indicator Light Not Resetting:**
    *   **Solution:** Press and hold the reset button for a longer duration. Ensure the filter is fully seated in its compartment.
*   **Unusual Taste (New Filter):**
    *   **Solution:** Flush the new filter with more water cycles. Discard initial filtered water. If taste persists, the filter might be faulty; contact customer support.

## Maintaining Your PUR System for Lasting Performance

Changing your PUR filter regularly is vital. However, other steps ensure your system lasts and works well. Proper maintenance helps keep your water truly clean. It extends the life of your PUR pitcher, dispenser, or faucet mount. These are simple actions you can take.

Regular cleaning of your PUR unit is important. Over time, mineral deposits can build up. Algae can also grow if the unit is exposed to light. For pitchers and dispensers, wash all parts regularly with mild soap and water. You can use a soft brush to clean inside crevices. Make sure to rinse all parts thoroughly to remove soap residue. Do not put the filter itself in soap, just the housing. For faucet mounts, wipe down the exterior. You can use a damp cloth to clean around the connection point. This helps prevent buildup and keeps the unit looking good.

Proper storage of spare filters is also important. Keep new, unused filters in their original sealed packaging. Store them in a cool, dry place. Avoid extreme temperatures or direct sunlight. Filters can absorb odors from the air. Storing them well helps prevent this. Do not open the filter packaging until you are ready to use it. An opened filter might dry out or get contaminated before use.

Always use cold water with your PUR filter. Hot water can damage the filter media. This reduces its effectiveness. Filters are designed for cold tap water only. Also, only use genuine PUR replacement filters. Generic filters might not fit properly. They also might not meet PUR's quality standards. Using non-PUR filters can damage your system. It can also void your warranty.

Finally, stay informed about your specific model. PUR may release updated filter types or care instructions. Check the manual or the PUR website for your model. Following these simple maintenance tips keeps your PUR system in top condition. This ensures you always have access to clean, fresh water. Taking care of your system means it takes care of you.
