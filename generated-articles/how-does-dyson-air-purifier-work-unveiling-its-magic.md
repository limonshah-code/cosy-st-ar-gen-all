Understanding [Dyson air purifier filter how long does it last](https://cosyhomecreation.com/dyson-air-purifier-filter-how-long-does-it-last) is important for maintaining performance.

#### HEPA Filter

The High-Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter is the first line of defense. It is specifically designed to capture tiny particles from the air. This filter is pleated, which creates a large surface area for trapping pollutants. The HEPA filter in Dyson purifiers meets strict standards.

It captures 99.97% of airborne particles as small as 0.3 microns. These particles include:

*   Allergens (pollen, dust mites, pet dander)
*   Bacteria
*   Mold spores
*   Fine dust
*   Pet dander

The HEPA filter is crucial for people with allergies or asthma. It physically traps these irritants, removing them from your breathing space. This mechanical filtration is highly effective.

#### Activated Carbon Filter

After passing through the HEPA filter, the air moves to the activated carbon filter. This filter handles the gaseous pollutants and odors. Activated carbon is a highly porous material. It has millions of tiny pores that trap gas molecules through adsorption.

The activated carbon filter targets:

*   Household odors (cooking smells, pet odors)
*   Harmful gases (Volatile Organic Compounds - VOCs)
*   Fumes from cleaning products
*   Formaldehyde
*   Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)

This dual-layer filtration ensures that both particles and gases are removed. The sealed system means no dirty air escapes during this process. Knowing [Dyson air purifier filter how often](https://cosyhomecreation.com/dyson-air-purifier-filter-how-often) to change the filters helps maintain this high level of purification. The combination of HEPA and activated carbon filters is what makes Dyson air purifiers so effective.

### Air Circulation: Dyson's Air Multiplier Technology

After the air has been thoroughly filtered, a Dyson air purifier does not just release it weakly. It uses a powerful and unique technology called Air Multiplier.
