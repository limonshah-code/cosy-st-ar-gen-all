## How Long Does It Take For A Dog To Recover From Being High?

Finding your beloved dog acting strangely can be truly alarming. You might notice them stumbling, drooling, or looking disoriented. When you suspect your dog has ingested cannabis, your mind races with concern. Many pet owners ask: **How long does it take for a dog to recover from being high?** Knowing the signs, understanding the recovery timeline, and knowing what to do immediately are crucial steps. This article explains the effects of cannabis on dogs, guides you through the recovery process, and provides essential tips for keeping your furry friend safe.

**Takeaway:**

*   Act fast if you suspect cannabis ingestion.
*   Seek veterinary help immediately for professional guidance.
*   Monitor your dog closely during recovery, keeping them safe and comfortable.
*   Prevent future incidents by securing all cannabis products.

**Clear, Concise Answer:**
A dog's recovery time from being high typically ranges from a few hours to several days, depending on the amount of THC ingested, the dog's size, and the potency of the product. Mild cases might resolve in 6-12 hours, while severe intoxication can last up to 72 hours or more, requiring professional veterinary intervention.

### Understanding THC Toxicity in Dogs

Dogs react differently to cannabis than humans do. Their bodies process chemicals in unique ways. THC, the psychoactive compound in cannabis, is much more potent for dogs. This means even a small amount can cause significant effects. Dogs have more cannabinoid receptors in their brains compared to humans. These receptors bind with THC, leading to amplified neurological effects. It is vital to understand this difference.

The effects of THC on dogs can range from mild disorientation to severe neurological depression. Your dog's size, metabolism, and existing health conditions also play a role. A small dog consuming a strong edible will likely suffer more severe symptoms than a large dog ingesting a small amount of low-potency flower. Edibles are especially dangerous because they often contain higher concentrations of THC. They may also contain other harmful ingredients like chocolate, which is toxic to dogs. Ingestion is the most common way dogs get high. This can happen by eating marijuana flower, edibles, or even secondhand smoke.

### Recognizing the Signs: Is Your Dog High?

Observing your dog's behavior is the first step. The signs of cannabis intoxication in dogs can vary. They depend on the amount consumed and the dog's individual sensitivity. Some common signs are easy to spot. Dogs might appear lethargic or unusually sleepy. They might stumble as if drunk, a sign known as static ataxia. My own dog, once, after a small accidental exposure to a discarded joint, looked at me with glazed eyes and struggled to walk in a straight line. It was quite scary.

Other signs include dilated pupils, drooling, or vomiting. Some dogs may become agitated, while others show extreme sensitivity to sounds or touch. In more severe cases, dogs may experience tremors, seizures, or even fall into a coma. They might also urinate uncontrollably. Symptoms usually begin within 30 minutes to an hour after ingestion. For edibles, it can take longer, up to several hours, because the substance needs to be digested. Knowing these signs helps you act quickly. The quicker you recognize the problem, the sooner you can seek help.

### Immediate Steps: What to Do When Your Dog Is High

If you suspect your dog is high, time is of the essence. Your immediate actions can greatly influence their recovery. First, stay calm. Panicking will not help your dog. Next, secure any remaining cannabis products to prevent further ingestion. This is a critical step. Remove your dog from the area where they ingested the substance. Place them in a quiet, safe, and dark room. This helps reduce external stimuli, which can worsen anxiety in a high dog.

Contact your veterinarian immediately. Do not wait for symptoms to worsen. Tell your vet everything you know: what your dog ate, how much, and when. Be honest. This information helps the vet determine the best course of action. If your dog is showing severe symptoms like seizures or loss of consciousness, this is an emergency. Rush your dog to the nearest animal emergency clinic. Trying to induce vomiting at home is not recommended. It can be dangerous and may not be effective. A vet can safely induce vomiting if appropriate, or provide other medical interventions. Understanding [how long does it take for a dog to get sick from something they ate](https://www.cosyhomecreation.com/how-long-does-it-take-for-a-dog-to-get-sick-from-something-they-ate) might provide some context on the onset of symptoms, but THC acts very quickly in their system.

### The Recovery Timeline: How Long Does It Take For A Dog To Recover From Being High?

The time it takes for a dog to recover from being high varies widely. Several factors influence this timeline. The amount of THC ingested is the primary factor. A small crumb of a high-potency edible will affect a dog more profoundly than a sniff of secondhand smoke. The dog's size and metabolism also play a role. Smaller dogs generally show more pronounced and prolonged effects. Their bodies process toxins differently.

Typically, mild cases of cannabis intoxication might see resolution within 6 to 12 hours. This usually involves symptoms like lethargy or mild coordination issues. For moderate cases, where symptoms include significant incoordination, vomiting, or increased heart rate, recovery can extend to 24-48 hours. Severe intoxication, involving seizures, coma, or very low heart rate, may require 48-72 hours or even longer for full recovery. Some dogs may feel "off" for a few days after the main symptoms subside. It is also important to consider [how long does it take for a dog to poop out something he ate](https://www.cosyhomecreation.com/how-long-does-it-take-for-a-dog-to-poop-out-something-he-ate), as the body needs to eliminate the toxin completely. Patience and constant monitoring are key during this period.

### Veterinary Care: Professional Help for THC Toxicity

When your dog is high, professional veterinary care is often necessary. A vet can accurately assess the severity of the intoxication. They can provide treatments that a pet owner cannot offer at home. The vet will perform a physical exam and may conduct blood tests. These tests help rule out other conditions and assess organ function. Sometimes, vets use activated charcoal. This substance helps absorb the toxins in your dog's stomach and intestines. This prevents further absorption into the bloodstream.

Intravenous fluids are another common treatment. Fluids help support blood pressure and kidney function. They also help flush the toxins out of your dog's system faster. In some cases, medication might be necessary to control seizures or reduce anxiety. The vet might keep your dog hospitalized for observation. This ensures constant monitoring and immediate intervention if symptoms worsen. Veterinary intervention significantly improves the prognosis for affected dogs. It ensures a safer and often quicker recovery process.

### Supporting Your Dog's Recovery at Home

Once your dog returns home from the vet or if their symptoms are mild, home care is crucial. Create a quiet, comfortable, and safe environment for your dog. They need a soft bed in a dim, peaceful area. This helps them rest and reduces sensory overload. Make sure fresh water is always available. Encourage them to drink, but do not force it. Hydration supports their body's natural detoxification process. Offer small, bland meals if they show interest in eating. Cooked plain chicken or boiled rice can be gentle on their stomach.

Monitor your dog's behavior constantly. Watch for any changes in their breathing, heart rate, or coordination. Keep a close eye on their urination and bowel movements. These can indicate how well their body is expelling the toxins. Take them out for bathroom breaks on a leash, even in your yard, to prevent accidents. They might still be disoriented. Be patient and offer gentle reassurance. Your presence can be very comforting. If any concerning symptoms return or worsen, contact your vet immediately. Just like dealing with other strong smells, you might also consider what it takes to get rid of a lingering odor, though this is less related to direct recovery and more about maintaining a fresh home environment. For instance, sometimes a lingering pet odor might need attention, similar to how one might wonder [how long does it take to get dog smell out of a house](https://www.cosyhomecreation.com/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-dog-smell-out-of-a-house) after an incident. This also applies if your dog had an accident or vomited indoors.

### Preventing Future Incidents: Keeping Your Dog Safe

Prevention is always better than treatment. Taking steps to keep your dog safe from cannabis exposure is essential. Store all cannabis products, including edibles, flower, and oils, in secure places. Child-proof containers or high shelves are good options. Treat cannabis like any other potentially harmful substance, such as medications or cleaning supplies. Educate everyone in your household about the dangers of cannabis to pets. Make sure guests also understand. Ask them to secure their products when visiting your home.

Be mindful of discarded items when out on walks. Dogs are curious creatures. They will sniff and often try to eat things they find on the ground. Keep your dog on a leash in public areas. This allows you to control what they investigate. If you use cannabis yourself, avoid exposing your dog to secondhand smoke. Smoke can irritate their respiratory system. It can also lead to THC absorption through inhalation. Maintaining a safe home environment protects your dog from accidental ingestion. Taking these precautions ensures your dog's well-being. Even managing a severe pet odor like a skunk spray involves prevention and immediate action, much like protecting your pet from toxins. For example, if your dog were to encounter a skunk, you would want to know [how long does it take to get skunk smell out of a dog](https://www.cosyhomecreation.com/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-skunk-smell-out-of-a-dog). This emphasizes the importance of managing environmental factors for your pet's safety and comfort.

### The Long-Term Outlook for Dogs After THC Exposure

Most dogs recover fully from THC intoxication. The prognosis is generally good, especially with prompt veterinary care. However, severe cases can sometimes lead to complications. Prolonged seizures can cause brain damage, though this is rare. Dogs with underlying health conditions might experience more severe reactions. For instance, a dog with heart issues could be at higher risk. Kidney or liver problems can also complicate recovery.

It is rare for a dog to die from THC intoxication alone. However, death can occur in very severe cases, especially if large amounts of highly potent cannabis are ingested and treatment is delayed. The good news is that with quick action and proper support, most dogs return to their normal selves. Once your dog has recovered, continue to monitor them for a few days. Ensure they are eating, drinking, and behaving normally. If you notice any lingering issues, consult your vet. Preventing future exposure is the best way to ensure your dog lives a long, healthy life.

### FAQ Section

**1. Can a dog die from being high?**
While rare, severe THC intoxication can be fatal, especially with large doses of highly potent products or in smaller dogs. Immediate veterinary attention is critical to prevent life-threatening complications. Prompt treatment significantly reduces the risk of serious outcomes.

**2. What is the best way to sober up a dog?**
There is no quick way to "sober up" a dog. The best approach is to seek veterinary care. Vets can provide supportive care like IV fluids and activated charcoal to help the dog's body process and eliminate the THC. Do not try home remedies.

**3. How long do edibles affect dogs?**
Edibles typically affect dogs longer than other forms of cannabis. This is because digestion is a slower process, leading to prolonged absorption of THC. Effects can last from 12 hours to several days, depending on potency and amount.

**4. Are there long-term effects of a dog being high?**
In most cases of acute THC intoxication, there are no reported long-term effects once the dog has fully recovered. However, repeated exposure or very severe single incidents could potentially lead to chronic issues, though this is not well-documented. Prevention is key.

**5. What should I tell the vet if my dog ate weed?**
Tell your vet exactly what your dog ate (flower, edible, etc.), how much, and when. Be honest about the source and potency if known. This information helps the vet diagnose and treat your dog effectively and quickly.

**6. Should I induce vomiting in my dog?**
No, do not try to induce vomiting at home. It can be dangerous and may not be effective. THC can cause rapid sedation, which increases the risk of aspiration (inhaling vomit into the lungs). Let your veterinarian decide if inducing vomiting is safe and necessary.

### Conclusion

Discovering your dog is high can be a frightening experience. Knowing **how long does it take for a dog to recover from being high** provides a crucial understanding for pet owners. The recovery timeline varies, from a few hours to several days, depending on the amount and potency of cannabis ingested, as well as your dog's size. Immediate action, recognizing the symptoms, and prompt veterinary care are paramount for a positive outcome.
