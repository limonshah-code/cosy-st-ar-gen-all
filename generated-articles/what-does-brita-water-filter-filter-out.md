A Brita water filter primarily reduces substances like chlorine, copper, mercury, and cadmium. Specific Brita filter models, such as the Brita Elite, also effectively lower levels of lead, benzene, asbestos, and certain pharmaceuticals found in tap water. They significantly improve water taste and odor.

## Understanding Brita Filter Technology

Brita filters use smart technology to clean your water. Most Brita filters contain two main components. These are activated carbon and ion-exchange resin. Each part plays a key role in removing different impurities.

Activated carbon is very porous. It acts like a sponge, trapping many substances. Ion-exchange resin works differently. It swaps unwanted ions for harmless ones. Together, these materials provide effective filtration. Understanding how they work helps explain what a Brita filter filters out. This twin approach makes Brita filters popular for daily use.

### Activated Carbon Filtration

Activated carbon is a powerful filter material. It comes from natural sources like coconut shells. The carbon undergoes a special heating process. This creates many tiny pores on its surface. When water flows through, these pores trap contaminants.

Activated carbon excels at removing organic compounds. It significantly reduces chlorine taste and odor. It also lessens the presence of some industrial chemicals. This process is called adsorption. The impurities stick to the carbon's surface. Activated carbon is a core part of almost every Brita filter.

### Ion-Exchange Resin

Ion-exchange resin is another vital part of Brita filters. It looks like small beads. These beads have a special charge. They attract certain dissolved substances in the water. For example, the resin pulls in heavy metals.

The resin then releases harmless ions back into the water. This is a "swap" action. Ion-exchange resin is good at reducing lead, copper, and cadmium. It also plays a role in reducing water hardness, though Brita filters are not designed for full water softening. This dual filtration system makes Brita effective against a wide range of impurities.
