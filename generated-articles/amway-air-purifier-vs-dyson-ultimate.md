It targets a wide range of chemical contaminants. Dyson's carbon filter also performs well. Some Dyson models specifically target formaldehyde, converting it into harmless water and CO2.

Understanding what a HEPA filter does is important. A [HEPA filter](https://cosyhomecreation.com/air-purifier-vs-hepa-filter) is not the air purifier itself. It is a type of highly efficient filter. It is the gold standard for particle removal in air purification. Both brands use this standard. This ensures they are effective against common allergens and particulate matter. The key difference lies in the reported minimum particle size captured.

Some air purifiers also use ionization. An [air purifier vs air ionizer](https://cosyhomecreation.com/air-purifier-vs-air-ionizer) comparison shows that ionizers release charged particles into the air. These particles attach to pollutants, making them fall out of the air. While some Amway models in the past included an ionizer feature, newer premium models often focus on mechanical filtration only. Dyson generally avoids ionizers. This is due to potential ozone production. Both brands prioritize a safe and effective purification method.

### Performance and Coverage: CADR and Room Size

Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) is a key metric. It tells you how fast an air purifier cleans a room. CADR values are typically given for smoke, pollen, and dust. Higher CADR numbers mean faster cleaning. The Amway Atmosphere Sky boasts impressive CADR ratings. It has a CADR of 300 for smoke, 300 for pollen, and 300 for dust. This indicates it can purify air effectively in very large rooms. It is certified by AHAM for rooms up to 465 square feet. This makes it suitable for open-concept living spaces or large bedrooms.

Dyson's approach to CADR is slightly different. They often highlight their ability to clean and circulate air throughout an entire room. Dyson purifiers do not always list traditional CADR numbers as prominently as Amway. Instead, Dyson often focuses on "whole-room purification" claims. They test their machines in a large 81 cubic meter room with multiple sensors. This test aims to show even distribution of purified air. While their exact CADR numbers may vary by model, they are generally designed for smaller to medium-sized rooms, depending on the specific model's output. Some Dyson models are rated for rooms up to 999 square feet, but this can be misleading as the CADR would be significantly lower for such a large space.

For a large room, Amway generally provides a higher CADR, indicating faster and more thorough air changes. Dyson's strength lies in its ability to circulate air effectively and its multi-functionality. If you need dedicated, rapid air cleaning for a large area, Amway's high CADR is a strong point.
