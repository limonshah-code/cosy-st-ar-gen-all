## Integrating Solitude into a Busy Schedule

Even the busiest schedules can make room for alone time. You do not need large blocks of time. Small, consistent moments add up. The key is to be intentional. Find creative ways to weave solitude into your day.

Start with micro-moments. Take five minutes of quiet before your family wakes up. Sip your coffee in silence. Sit by a window and just observe. These small pockets of peace can be very powerful. They set a positive tone for your day.
