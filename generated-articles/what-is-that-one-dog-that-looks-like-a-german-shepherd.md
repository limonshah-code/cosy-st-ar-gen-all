Many people find themselves asking, "What is that one dog that looks like a German Shepherd?" You are not alone in this curiosity. The German Shepherd Dog has a very distinct appearance, but several other breeds share many of its classic features.

These dogs might have a similar body shape, coat color, or alert expression. Sometimes, they even share similar working dog characteristics. We will explore several breeds often mistaken for German Shepherds. We will cover their unique traits, and explain what makes them similar yet different. This article helps you identify these breeds and understand their needs.

### Takeaway

A dog that looks like a German Shepherd is often a Belgian Malinois, a Dutch Shepherd, or an Eastern European Shepherd. Other breeds like the Siberian Husky and Alaskan Malamute also share some physical traits, particularly coat patterns and builds, leading to occasional confusion.

## Defining the German Shepherd Look

The German Shepherd Dog has a very recognizable appearance. This breed is known for its noble stance and athletic build. People often identify them by specific physical traits.

German Shepherds typically have a medium to large size. Males stand about 24-26 inches tall and weigh 65-90 pounds. Females are slightly smaller. They possess a strong, muscular body. Their gait is graceful and flowing.

Their coat is often bi-colored, meaning two colors. Common combinations include black and tan, black and red, or black and cream. They can also be solid black, sable, or even white. The coat is usually dense and can be medium to long in length. A German Shepherd's ears stand erect and pointed. Their eyes are almond-shaped and dark, showing intelligence and alertness. They have a bushy tail that usually hangs down in a slight curve. These features together create the iconic German Shepherd silhouette that many people recognize.

## Belgian Malinois: The Striking Resemblance

When people ask, "What is that one dog that looks like a German Shepherd?" the answer is often the Belgian Malinois. This breed shares many visual traits with the German Shepherd. However, key differences exist. Many people mistake Malinois for German Shepherds. This happens frequently due to their similar color and build.

Belgian Malinois are highly intelligent and very active dogs. They have a lean, athletic body. They are slightly smaller and more fine-boned than German Shepherds. Malinois typically weigh between 40-80 pounds. Their coat is usually short and ranges from fawn to mahogany. They often have a black mask on their face. Their ears are erect and triangular, like the German Shepherd's. The way they carry themselves, with an alert and ready posture, also reminds people of a German Shepherd. My own friend once thought my Malinois was a small German Shepherd puppy.

Despite the visual similarities, their temperaments differ. Malinois are known for their extremely high energy levels. They need a lot of exercise and mental stimulation. They excel in dog sports, police work, and protection. German Shepherds also need activity, but Malinois often require more intense and focused training.

## Dutch Shepherd: Another Athletic Canine Look-Alike

Another dog that often leads people to ask, "What is that one dog that looks like a German Shepherd?" is the Dutch Shepherd. This breed also comes from Europe, like the German Shepherd and Belgian Malinois. Dutch Shepherds are known for their intelligence and versatility. They are working dogs with strong instincts.

Dutch Shepherds are medium to large in size. They have a muscular build. Their unique coat patterns make them stand out. They often come in brindle patterns. This means stripes of different shades across their coat. The colors can be gold brindle, silver brindle, or even blue brindle. Some also have a solid coat. Their ears are erect and triangular, similar to German Shepherds. Their overall body shape and alert expression are also very much alike. This contributes to the common confusion between the two breeds.

There are three coat types for Dutch Shepherds:
*   **Short-haired**: This is the most common type. Their coat is short and close-fitting.
*   **Long-haired**: These dogs have a long, straight coat. It is rough to the touch.
*   **Wire-haired**: This type has a dense, harsh, and curly coat.

Dutch Shepherds are very active and loyal. They need consistent training and plenty of exercise. They are excellent family dogs for active households. They make good watchdogs and protective companions. Their intelligence means they learn commands quickly.

## Eastern European Shepherd: The Sturdy Cousin

When considering dogs that look like German Shepherds, the Eastern European Shepherd is a notable breed. This dog is sometimes called the Byelorussian Shepherd or the Vostochno Evropeiskaya Ovcharka (VEO). It was specifically bred in the Soviet Union. Breeders aimed to create a larger, more resilient version of the German Shepherd. They wanted a dog that could handle harsh Russian climates.

The Eastern European Shepherd indeed looks very much like a German Shepherd, but often bigger. They have a strong, heavy bone structure. Their heads are broad, and their bodies are powerful. They are known for their calm and steady temperament, unlike some other high-drive working breeds. This breed is often used in military and police roles in its native region. Its size and strength make it an imposing presence.

VEOs typically have a dense, thick coat. This coat helps them withstand cold weather. Their colors are similar to German Shepherds, including black and tan, black and cream, or solid black. Their ears are erect. Their eyes are dark and expressive. They carry themselves with confidence and dignity. Many people might not realize this breed exists. They just think it is a very large German Shepherd.
