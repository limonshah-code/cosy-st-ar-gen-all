## Find Your Frigidaire Dishwasher Model Number

Finding your Frigidaire dishwasher model number can feel like a small treasure hunt. This number is very important for many reasons. You need it when you order new parts for your appliance. You also need it when you schedule a repair.

Knowing the model number helps ensure you get the right component. It also helps technicians bring the correct tools. This guide helps you locate the model number on your Frigidaire dishwasher. We will explore common spots and give you tips for finding it quickly. My goal is to make this process simple for you.

### Takeaway

*   Check the inner door frame or door jamb first.
*   Look on the kick plate at the bottom front of the dishwasher.
*   Inspect the control panel or sides of the tub.
*   Note down both model and serial numbers for future use.

### Quick Answer: Where Is Model Number On Frigidaire Dishwasher

You can find the model number on a Frigidaire dishwasher in several key places. The most common location is on a label or sticker along the inner door frame, also known as the door jamb. Other possible spots include the kick plate at the bottom front, the side of the dishwasher tub, or even on the control panel.

## Why Finding Your Frigidaire Dishwasher Model Number Is Important

Knowing your Frigidaire dishwasher model number saves you time and money. This number is a unique identifier for your specific appliance. It tells repair technicians exactly which unit you own. This means they can diagnose issues more accurately before they even arrive.

When you need to buy a replacement part, the model number is essential. Parts are designed for specific models. Using the wrong part can cause further damage or simply not work. Having the number ready ensures you purchase the correct component. This prevents frustrating returns and wasted effort.

Your model number is also vital for warranty claims. If your dishwasher needs service under warranty, the manufacturer will ask for this information. It helps them verify your purchase and coverage. For any questions about your appliance, Frigidaire customer support will also ask for this number. Without it, they cannot offer specific help for your machine. This number helps you get quick, accurate support every time.

## Common Locations for Your Frigidaire Dishwasher Model Number

Frigidaire places model number stickers in standard spots on their dishwashers. These locations are usually easy to access. Knowing where to look helps you find the information quickly. I will walk you through the most frequent places where Frigidaire puts these labels.

### Inside the Door Jamb or Frame

The inner door jamb is the most common place to find your Frigidaire dishwasher model number. This is the area surrounding the dishwasher opening when the door is open. You need to open the dishwasher door completely. Look along the top edge, the side edges, or the bottom edge of the opening.

The sticker is often white or silver. It has black text printed on it. This label contains both the model number and the serial number. Sometimes, it also includes manufacturing details. Make sure you check all four sides of this inner frame. The label might be small. This spot is a prime location because it stays protected from wear and tear.

### On the Kick Plate or Toe Kick

Another frequent spot for the model number is the kick plate. This is the removable panel at the very bottom front of your dishwasher. It often hides the motor and other components. You might need to kneel down to see it.

The kick plate usually attaches with two or four screws. You may not need to remove it to see the sticker. Just look carefully at the front surface of the plate. The label could be on the visible side. If not, gently remove the screws and pull the plate forward. The sticker might be on the back of the plate, or on the frame behind it. This location is common for many appliance manufacturers.

### On the Side of the Tub

Some Frigidaire dishwasher models have their identification sticker on the side of the tub. This means you need to pull the dishwasher out of its cabinet enclosure. This is not always an easy task. I recommend checking the other locations first.

If you must pull it out, ensure you turn off the power first. Disconnect water lines if necessary. The sticker will be on one of the outer side panels of the dishwasher tub. This location is less common than the door jamb or kick plate. However, it is a possibility for some models.

### Behind the Control Panel

Less commonly, the model number sticker might be behind the control panel. This applies especially to older Frigidaire models or integrated dishwashers. Accessing this area typically requires disassembling part of the front panel. I do not recommend this as a first step.

Removing parts of your dishwasher can be risky. You might damage components. Only attempt this if you are comfortable with appliance repair. Always disconnect power to the dishwasher before you start any disassembly. This location is usually a last resort for finding the number.

### On the Rear of the Appliance

The very back of the dishwasher often holds another identification label. This label usually has the model and serial numbers. It also often includes electrical specifications. Accessing this sticker requires pulling the entire dishwasher out from its space.

As with checking the side of the tub, this can be difficult. It also requires disconnecting water and power lines. You will need help to move the appliance safely. Only check this spot if you have exhausted all other, easier locations. This location provides complete information about the unit.

## Tips for Easily Locating Your Dishwasher Model Number

Finding a small sticker on a large appliance can be tricky. Sometimes, the label is faded or in a hard-to-see spot. I have some tips to help you in your search. These suggestions can make the process much smoother.

### Use Proper Lighting

Good lighting is your best friend when looking for the model number. Appliance interiors are often dark. The sticker might be in a shadowed area. Use a bright flashlight or your phone's light. Shine the light directly onto the areas you are inspecting.

This helps illuminate any small text or faded print. It can make the difference between finding the number and giving up. Do not rely solely on ambient room light. Direct light is much more effective for reading small details.

### Clean the Area

Over time, grease, food debris, or water spots can obscure the sticker. Before you start looking, wipe down the potential areas. Use a damp cloth to gently clean the door jamb, kick plate, and surrounding surfaces. This removes any grime that might be hiding the label.

A clean surface makes the text much easier to read. Avoid harsh chemicals as they can damage the sticker. Simple soap and water work well. Make sure the area is dry before you attempt to read the numbers.

### Take a Photo

Once you find the sticker, take a clear picture of it with your phone. This creates a digital record of your model and serial numbers. You will not have to search for it again in the future. It is also useful if the sticker fades further over time.

Having a photo means you can zoom in on the numbers. This helps if the print is very small. Store this photo in a dedicated folder on your phone. You can also print it out and keep it with your appliance manuals. This simple step saves future hassle.

### Check the User Manual or Registration Card

If you still have the original user manual or product registration card, check there first. Manufacturers print the model number on these documents. This is often the easiest way to find the information without bending down. The manual also contains helpful diagrams.

Your appliance might have come with a separate registration card. This card usually requires you to fill in the model and serial numbers. If you filled it out, that card has your numbers. Keep these documents in a safe place. They are valuable resources for your appliance.

## Understanding Frigidaire Dishwasher Numbers: Model vs. Serial

It is important to know the difference between a model number and a serial number. Both are on the same sticker, but they serve different purposes. Knowing what each number means helps you when dealing with service or parts.

### What Is a Model Number?

The model number identifies the specific design and features of your appliance. It tells you what type of Frigidaire dishwasher you have. For example, all Frigidaire dishwashers of the same model number are identical. They share the same parts and specifications.

When you need to order a replacement part, you must provide the model number. Parts are often specific to certain models or model ranges. This number ensures you get the exact component that fits your machine. The model number helps determine compatibility.

### What Is a Serial Number?

The serial number identifies your specific unit. Think of it like a vehicle identification number (VIN) for a car. No two Frigidaire dishwashers have the same serial number. This number tells the manufacturer exactly when and where your appliance was made.

The serial number is crucial for warranty claims. It allows Frigidaire to track the age of your unit. It also helps them identify specific production batches. If there is a product recall, the serial number helps determine if your unit is affected. While model numbers identify the *type* of product, serial numbers identify the *individual* product. Knowing [where the serial number on a Miele washing machine](https://cosyhomecreation.com/where-is-the-serial-number-on-a-miele-washing-machine) is can give you an idea of how manufacturers use these identifiers across different brands.

## What to Do If You Cannot Find the Model Number

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, the model number sticker is gone or illegible. This can be frustrating. Do not worry; you still have options. I will outline some alternative methods to get the information you need.

### Check Original Sales Receipts or Invoice

Your original sales receipt or invoice often lists the appliance's model number. This document is proof of purchase. It usually includes detailed product information. Check the description of your dishwasher on the receipt.

Look for a line item that specifies the model number. Keep your receipts organized for this reason. A digital receipt from an online purchase is also a good place to look. This is a very reliable way to find the number if the physical sticker is missing.

### Contact the Retailer

If you purchased your Frigidaire dishwasher from a major appliance retailer, they might have records. Contact their customer service department. Provide them with your purchase date and your name. They may be able to look up your purchase history.

The retailer's system might store the model number linked to your transaction. This method works best if you bought the appliance recently. Older purchases might be harder for them to retrieve. Give them as much detail as you can about your purchase.

### Search Online with Appliance Photos

If all else fails, you can try searching online using visual cues. Take clear photos of your Frigidaire dishwasher from different angles. Focus on unique features like the control panel layout or handle design. Upload these photos to a search engine.

Use terms like "Frigidaire dishwasher" plus a description of its features. For example, "Frigidaire dishwasher top controls black handle." You might find images of similar models. This can help you narrow down the possibilities. This method is not foolproof, but it can provide clues. You might even find images of old product catalogs.

## Using Your Frigidaire Dishwasher Model Number

Once you have found your model number, you can use it for many important tasks. This number is your key to proper maintenance and repair. It helps you get the right support. I will explain how to put this number to good use.

### Ordering Replacement Parts

The most common reason for needing your model number is to order parts. Whether you need a new spray arm, a soap dispenser, or a drain pump, the model number ensures compatibility. Appliance parts websites or local stores will ask for it. Inputting the correct model number shows you only the parts designed for your unit. This avoids mistakes.

If you order a part without the correct model number, it likely will not fit. This leads to delays and wasted money. Always double-check the model number before finalizing any part order. This saves you hassle later.

### Scheduling Service or Repairs

When your Frigidaire dishwasher needs professional service, the technician will ask for the model number. This helps them prepare for the service call. They can look up diagrams and common issues for your specific model. This means they might arrive with the necessary parts already.

Knowing the model number speeds up the repair process. The technician spends less time diagnosing. They can go straight to fixing the problem. This saves you money on labor costs. If your dishwasher has issues like [how to get the dishwasher to drain](https://cosyhomecreation.com/how-to-get-the-dishwasher-to-drain) or [why is my dishwasher buzzing](https://cosyhomecreation.com/why-is-my-dishwasher-buzzing), providing the model number helps the technician understand potential causes specific to your unit.

### Accessing User Manuals and Schematics

Frigidaire's official website offers digital copies of user manuals. You usually need your model number to find the correct manual. These manuals contain valuable information. They have operating instructions, cleaning tips, and troubleshooting guides.

Schematics are diagrams that show the internal workings of your dishwasher. These are useful for advanced DIY repairs. Manufacturers make these available based on model numbers. Accessing the right manual helps you understand your appliance better. It also helps you perform basic maintenance. Knowing [what KitchenAid dishwasher model numbers mean](https://cosyhomecreation.com/what-do-kitchenaid-dishwasher-model-numbers-mean) can also give you insight into how these numbers organize product information, even for a different brand.

### Checking for Recalls

Occasionally, appliance manufacturers issue recalls for safety reasons or defects. You can check for recalls using your model number. Government consumer product safety websites maintain databases of recalled items. Enter your model number to see if your Frigidaire dishwasher is affected.

If your appliance is part of a recall, follow the manufacturer's instructions. They will provide information on repair, replacement, or refund options. Checking for recalls is important for your safety. It also ensures your appliance performs as expected.

## FAQ Section

### How do I distinguish between the model and serial numbers on a Frigidaire dishwasher?

The model number typically contains a mix of letters and numbers, often in a longer format, identifying the specific product design. The serial number is usually a longer string of numbers, sometimes with letters, uniquely identifying your individual unit for manufacturing and warranty tracking. They are usually side-by-side on the same sticker.

### What if the model number sticker is damaged or unreadable?

If the sticker is damaged, check your original purchase receipt or invoice. Retailers often list the model number on these documents. You can also contact the store where you bought the dishwasher. They might have a record of your purchase with the model number included.

### Can I find the model number online without seeing my dishwasher?

You can sometimes find the model number online if you have the original receipt or warranty information. Many manufacturers also list model numbers on their websites. You would need to search for your specific Frigidaire dishwasher if you know the year of purchase and general appearance. This is less reliable without a physical check.

### Why do I need both the model and serial number for repairs?

The model number helps technicians identify the specific parts and common issues for your dishwasher's design. The serial number provides unique identification for your individual unit. This is vital for warranty claims, tracking manufacturing batches, and accessing precise service history. Both numbers together ensure accurate and efficient service.

### Is the model number on the control panel?

Some Frigidaire dishwashers, especially older or more integrated models, might have the model number on a label behind or on the edge of the control panel. This is less common than the door jamb or kick plate. It often requires removing parts of the panel to see the sticker, so check other spots first.

### What does the model number tell me about my Frigidaire dishwasher?

The model number tells you the specific series, features, and design of your Frigidaire dishwasher. It indicates things like capacity, wash cycles, color, and specific technologies included. This information is critical for ordering compatible replacement parts and understanding your appliance's capabilities.

## Conclusion

Finding the model number on your Frigidaire dishwasher does not have to be a chore. I hope this guide helps you pinpoint it quickly. Remember to always start by checking the inner door jamb. Then move to the kick plate. These are the most common and accessible locations.

Knowing your model number is important. It ensures you get the right parts when you need them. It also helps technicians provide quick, accurate service. Keep this number handy for future reference.
