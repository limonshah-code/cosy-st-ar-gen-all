## Understanding the Westminster Dog Show Schedule and Phases

The Westminster Dog Show is not just one big event. It unfolds over several days. Each day has different competitions and judging phases. Understanding the schedule helps you plan your viewing. It makes sure you do not miss your favorite parts. The show typically begins with preliminary events. These include Agility and Obedience competitions.

Agility and Obedience showcase a dog's training and athletic ability. Dogs navigate obstacle courses or perform precise commands. These events are very exciting to watch. They show the incredible bond between dogs and their handlers. Following these, the main conformation judging begins. This is where dogs are judged on how well they match their breed standard.

Breed judging happens first. Dogs of the same breed compete against each other. One dog is chosen as "Best of Breed." These winners then move on to the next stage. After breed judging, the seven group competitions begin. The groups are Hound, Toy, Non-Sporting, Herding, Sporting, Working, and Terrier. Each Best of Breed winner competes against others in their group. One dog from each group wins "Best in Group."

The final phase is the "Best in Show" competition. The seven "Best in Group" winners compete for the ultimate title. This is the climax of the entire event. It usually airs in prime time. Knowing [what time is the Westminster Dog Show on NBC](https://cosyhomecreation.com/what-time-is-the-westminster-dog-show-on-nbc) might still be a common search query due to historical broadcasts, even if it has moved to Fox Sports now.

Next, decide how you will watch. Will you use traditional cable TV? Or will you stream it online? Ensure your streaming device is ready. Check your internet connection. A strong connection prevents buffering during live events. I charge my tablet fully if I plan to watch on the go.

Consider creating a comfortable viewing setup. This might mean a cozy couch, some snacks, and your own dog beside you. Make it an event. Invite friends or family over for a viewing party. It is more fun to share the excitement. Discussing the dogs and judges' decisions with others adds to the fun.

Think about which events you want to focus on. Do you have a favorite breed? Or do you just want to see the "Best in Show" finale? Knowing your interests helps you navigate the schedule. Some people like to watch specific breed judging all day. Others only care about the final group competitions. My personal favorite is watching the Working Group.

Also, be ready to learn new things. Westminster is a great chance to see many dog breeds. You might discover a breed you never knew existed. Pay attention to the commentators. They offer insights into breed standards and judging. This adds an educational element to your viewing experience.

## Key Moments and Judging Criteria at Westminster

The Westminster Dog Show is more than just a beauty pageant. Judges evaluate dogs based on specific breed standards. This means they look at physical traits and temperament. Each breed has a detailed standard. It describes the ideal dog of that breed. Judges spend years learning these standards.

The judging process starts with breed judging. Here, dogs are compared to their breed standard. Judges look at movement, coat, structure, and overall appearance. They also consider temperament. A dog must be confident and well-behaved in the ring. The dog that best embodies its breed standard wins Best of Breed. This is a very important step.

After breed judging, the Best of Breed winners move to group judging. There are seven groups. Judges select the best dog from each group. This dog is the "Best in Group" winner. These are the seven finalists for Best in Show. It is exciting to see these top dogs compete against each other.

The "Best in Show" moment is the most anticipated. The seven group winners enter the ring. A single judge evaluates them all. This judge looks for overall excellence. They pick the dog that stands out the most. The winner receives the coveted purple and gold ribbon. This moment is what every exhibitor dreams of.

My favorite part is watching the handlers and dogs interact. You can see the dedication involved. Many hours of training go into preparing a dog for Westminster. Winning Best in Show is the highest honor in the dog show world. It signifies a dog that is an excellent example of its breed. It is truly special to witness this crowning moment each year.
