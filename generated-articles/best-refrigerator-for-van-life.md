Internal volume is measured in liters or quarts. How much food do you need to store? Do you cook a lot? Do you prefer fresh food over canned goods?

A 35-50 liter fridge is common for one or two people. Larger families might need 60-80 liters. Remember that a larger fridge uses more power. Think about where the fridge will sit. Can you access it easily? Will it block walkways or storage? Some fridges are [best portable refrigerators for cars](https://cosyhomecreation.com/best-portable-refrigerator-for-car) but may be too small for van life. Finding the right size ensures comfort.

### Durability and Build Quality

Van life means constant movement. Your fridge will experience bumps and vibrations. A durable fridge is a must. Look for strong construction. Metal casings are generally better than plastic. Heavy-duty latches keep the door secure. A robust handle helps with moving it.

Internal components also matter. A quality compressor lasts longer. Good insulation keeps food cold efficiently. This also reduces wear on the compressor. Read reviews about reliability. A reliable fridge prevents breakdowns. It saves you money and hassle on the road.
