## Effectively Remove Dog Hair from Your Washing Machine

Our furry friends bring joy, but they also bring fur. Dog hair on clothes is one challenge, but finding it stuck inside your washing machine is another. This can transfer hair to your next laundry load, making it a constant problem. You want clean clothes, not clothes covered in pet fur. This guide helps you understand why dog hair clings to laundry machines. We also explore practical steps to remove existing hair and prevent new build-up. We offer tips for pre-treating items, cleaning the machine itself, and ongoing maintenance. By the end, you will know how to get dog hair out of a washing machine effectively.

#### Takeaway:
*   Pre-treat hairy clothes before washing them.
*   Use specific additives during the wash cycle.
*   Clean your washing machine thoroughly after washing pet items.
*   Implement regular maintenance for a fur-free machine.

You can get dog hair out of a washing machine by first removing excess hair from clothes before washing. After a pet-related load, run an empty hot water cycle with vinegar or bleach. Clean the lint trap, rubber gasket, and drum thoroughly to remove trapped fur.

### Why Dog Hair Sticks in Your Washing Machine

Dog hair is a persistent problem for many pet owners. It clings to clothes and then transfers into the washing machine. Hair sticks to the drum, agitator, and rubber seals. This happens because of static electricity and the way wet hair clumps. When clothes tumble, hair releases and floats in the water. The spinning action pushes some hair out with the drain water. However, much of it can get caught in various parts of the machine.

Lint traps, filters, and drain pumps are common collection points. Front-load washers often trap hair in the rubber gasket around the door. Top-load washers may have hair cling to the agitator or the tub walls. Even after a wash, tiny hairs remain inside the machine. These hairs then attach to the next load of laundry. Understanding these sticking points helps us target our cleaning efforts.

### Pre-Washing Strategies for Pet Hair Removal

Removing as much dog hair as possible before washing is very important. This simple step prevents a large amount of hair from entering your machine. It saves you time and effort later on. There are several effective pre-washing methods you can use.

First, shake out clothes vigorously outdoors. This helps dislodge loose hair. Use a lint roller or a strong adhesive tape on items with a lot of fur. Roll the tape over the fabric to pick up hair. This method works well for blankets and pet beds. You can also use a rubber glove. Dampen a rubber glove and rub it over the fabric. The hair clumps together due to friction and moisture. This makes it easy to pick up.

Another useful tool is a pet hair remover brush designed for laundry. These brushes often have fine bristles that grab hair. Some pet owners also use a dry sponge. A clean, dry sponge rubbed across pet-covered items can lift hair. For heavy items like pet beds, consider vacuuming them first. Use a vacuum cleaner attachment to suction off surface hair. This significantly reduces the amount of hair that enters your washer. Taking these steps protects your washing machine from excess fur. This also makes your laundry cleaner.

### During the Wash Cycle: Adding Helpers

Even after pre-treating, some dog hair will enter the washing machine. You can add specific items or products during the wash cycle to help collect this hair. These helpers work by attracting or trapping loose fur. This keeps hair from redepositing onto clothes or sticking inside the machine.

One common helper is a laundry lint ball or pet hair catcher. These items float in the wash water and collect hair, lint, and debris. They usually have a textured surface or a mesh design to trap particles. Simply toss one or two into the washing machine with your laundry. After the cycle, remove the ball and clean off the collected hair. These are reusable and very effective.

Consider adding a half cup of white vinegar to the rinse cycle. Vinegar helps relax fabric fibers, allowing trapped hair to release. It also helps rinse away detergent residue and acts as a mild deodorizer. You can pour it into the fabric softener dispenser. For more tips on what to add, see our guide on [what to add to washing machine](https://cosyhomecreation.com/what-to-add-to-washing-machine). Another option is a cup of baking soda added directly to the wash drum with your detergent. Baking soda can help loosen hair from clothes. It also neutralizes odors. Using these natural additives can make a big difference in hair removal.

Some people also use a few dryer sheets during the wash cycle. The dryer sheets collect some hair due to static attraction. However, remove them before the spin cycle to avoid clogs. Always be mindful of the type of item you are washing. For example, if you are wondering [can I put my dogs collar in the washing machine](https://cosyhomecreation.com/can-i-put-my-dogs-collar-in-the-washing-machine), consider pre-wiping it and using a mesh bag. Using these methods helps your machine better handle pet hair. They also ensure your clothes come out cleaner.

### Post-Wash Machine Cleaning for Hair Removal

Cleaning your washing machine *after* washing pet items is critical. This step removes any hair that remains inside the drum or other components. If you skip this, leftover hair will transfer to your next laundry load. This creates a cycle of fur-covered clothes. Regular post-wash cleaning keeps your machine ready for the next use.

First, after removing your laundry, inspect the washing machine drum. Use a damp cloth or paper towel to wipe down the inside surfaces. Pay close attention to the rubber gasket on front-load washers. This gasket often traps a lot of hair, lint, and even small objects. Pull back the folds of the gasket and wipe thoroughly. For detailed guidance on removing pet hair from the machine itself, you can check out [how do you remove pet hair from a washing machine](https://cosyhomecreation.com/how-do-you-remove-pet-hair-from-a-washing-machine).

Next, run an empty rinse cycle or a quick clean cycle with hot water. Add a cup of white vinegar or a quarter cup of bleach to this empty cycle. This helps to flush out any remaining hair, detergent residue, and odors. It also sanitizes the machine. Make sure to choose a hot water setting for this cleaning cycle. The hot water helps dissolve any greasy residues that trap hair. You might also find it helpful to learn [how do you get dog hair out of the washing machine](https://cosyhomecreation.com/how-do-you-get-dog-hair-out-of-the-washing-machine) for more specific tips on this process.

Finally, clean the lint trap or filter if your machine has one. Many washing machines have a filter that collects lint and debris. The location varies by model. Refer to your owner's manual if you are unsure. This filter can become clogged with pet hair. A clogged filter reduces your machine's efficiency. It also prevents proper draining. Regularly cleaning this filter is a simple but important part of maintenance.

### Essential Maintenance and Prevention Tips

Keeping your washing machine free of dog hair is an ongoing process. Regular maintenance and preventative measures are essential. These steps help reduce hair build-up over time. They keep your machine running efficiently and your laundry clean.

One key prevention tip is to always groom your dog regularly. Brushing your dog daily reduces shedding around the house. This means less hair ends up on your clothes and, consequently, in your washing machine. Regular grooming benefits your pet's coat health too.

Before washing any heavily furred items, give them a good shake or pre-clean. As discussed, lint rollers, rubber gloves, or vacuuming work wonders. This significantly cuts down on the hair that enters the machine. Wash pet blankets and beds separately from regular laundry. This prevents hair transfer to your other clothes. For large items like pet beds, ensure they are machine washable. You might wonder, [can I put cat bed in washing machine](https://cosyhomecreation.com/can-i-put-cat-bed-in-washing-machine)? The same rules apply for dog beds. Always check care tags.

Clean your washing machine regularly, not just after a pet load. Aim for a deep clean once a month. This includes wiping down the drum and rubber gasket. Run a hot water cycle with a washing machine cleaner or vinegar. This helps flush out hidden hair and maintains freshness. Leave the washing machine door open after each use. This allows the machine to air out and dry completely. Airing it out prevents mold and mildew growth. Mold and mildew can trap hair and create odors. These simple habits make a big difference in maintaining a hair-free washing machine.

### Specific Machine Types: Front-Load vs. Top-Load

The type of washing machine you own affects how dog hair collects and how you clean it. Both front-load and top-load machines can accumulate hair. However, they have different common problem areas and cleaning methods. Understanding these differences helps you clean your machine more effectively.

**Front-Load Washing Machines:**
Front-loaders are known for their efficiency and gentle wash. However, they have a common hair-trapping spot: the rubber gasket around the door. This gasket forms a seal during the wash cycle. It also tends to collect water, dirt, and pet hair. After each use, especially after washing pet items, you must clean this gasket thoroughly. Pull back the folds of the rubber seal. Use a damp cloth to wipe away all hair, grime, and moisture. Ignoring this can lead to mold, odors, and hair transfer. Some modern front-loaders, like LG HE washing machines, have specific cleaning cycles. Knowing [how to clean LG HE washing machine](https://cosyhomecreation.com/how-to-clean-lg-he-washing-machine) can be helpful here. Also, front-loaders often have a drain pump filter located at the bottom front. This filter catches debris, including hair. Check your manual to find and clean this filter regularly. It prevents clogs and ensures proper draining.

**Top-Load Washing Machines:**
Top-load machines are generally simpler in design. They often have an agitator in the center or an impeller at the bottom. Hair tends to cling to the agitator and the sides of the wash tub. After a pet load, wipe down the agitator and the drum walls with a damp cloth. Some top-loaders have a removable lint filter, usually located on the agitator or near the top rim of the drum. These filters are designed to catch lint and hair. Clean this filter after every few loads, especially pet laundry. If your top-loader does not have a visible lint filter, the machine filters the water through the drain pump. In this case, ensure your pre-washing steps are very thorough to prevent hair from clogging the drain system. Both types of machines benefit from running an empty hot water cycle with vinegar or bleach to flush out remaining hair and sanitize the drum.

### Troubleshooting Persistent Hair Problems

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, dog hair seems to cling stubbornly to your washing machine or clothes. Persistent hair problems can be frustrating. However, there are additional steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve them. This involves checking components you might overlook or adjusting your laundry routine.

First, reassess your pre-washing routine. Are you removing enough hair before items enter the machine? Consider adding a more powerful pre-treatment step for extremely hairy items. For example, use a stiff brush to loosen hair outdoors. You can also try a quick tumble in a dryer on a "no heat" or "air fluff" setting for 10-15 minutes. The dryer's lint trap will catch a surprising amount of hair before washing.

Next, ensure your washing machine's drain pump filter is not clogged. This is a common culprit for hair recirculation. A clogged filter prevents efficient draining and can leave hair behind. Even if you clean it regularly, a large influx of hair can overwhelm it. If you are comfortable, you can perform some [do it yourself washing machine](https://cosyhomecreation.com/do-it-yourself-washing-machine) maintenance. Consult your machine's manual to locate and clean this filter thoroughly. Remove all debris, including tangled hair. This simple step often solves persistent hair issues.

Also, check your washing machine's water level and load size. Overloading the machine does not allow items to tumble freely. This means hair does not rinse away effectively. It gets trapped within the fabric or clumps inside the drum. Use adequate water for your load size. Ensure there is enough space for clothes to move. Using less detergent than recommended can also leave hair and residue behind. Use the correct amount of detergent for your load size and water hardness. If you have hard water, consider using a hard water filter. A [best hard water filter for washing machine](https://cosyhomecreation.com/best-hard-water-filter-for-washing-machine) can improve rinse performance. Finally, consider the water temperature. Hot water helps relax fibers and flush out hair more effectively than cold water. Adjusting these factors can significantly improve hair removal.
