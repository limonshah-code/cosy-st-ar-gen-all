## Factors to Consider Before Adopting Any Age Golden Retriever

Choosing the best age to adopt a Golden Retriever involves more than just preference. You must consider your own situation. Your lifestyle plays a big role in which age group fits best.

Your experience with dogs is also important. First-time owners might find a puppy overwhelming. An adult dog with known behaviors could be a better choice.

Your family structure matters. If you have young children, consider a dog known to be good with kids. Some adult rescue Golden Retrievers have lived with children before.

Your living space also impacts your choice. Do you live in an apartment or a house with a yard? Golden Retrievers are active dogs. They need space to move. They need daily exercise.
